Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global wireless mesh network market are: 

**Growth Drivers:**

- Rising demand for reliable and fast wireless communication in houses, businesses, and industrial setups for automation
- Increasing demand for IoT-enabled devices and the use of wireless mesh network technology in autonomous vehicles to monitor the traffic

**Challenges:**

High installation and maintenance costs, as well as limited scalability, are two of the major factors that could potentially limit the growth of the wireless mesh network market. Additionally, the lack of unified standards, as well as security and privacy issues, could also cause a slowdown in the global market size.

Home networking, video surveillance, disaster management, medical device connectivity, and traffic management are the primary applications of wireless mesh networks. A significant CAGR is forecast for the disaster management segment by the end of 2035 owing to the increase in natural disasters, such as floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes, which has created a need for efficient disaster management systems. Wireless mesh networks provide a reliable, secure, and cost-effective way to quickly deploy and manage a communication infrastructure in a disaster-affected area. This allows emergency responders to quickly collect and share information, coordinate operations, and provide assistance to those affected by the disaster.
