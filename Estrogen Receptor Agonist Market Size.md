***Rising Prevalence of Osteoporosis to Boost the Global Estrogen Receptor Agonist*** 

The global market for estrogen receptor agonist is projected to grow on account of the rising prevalence of osteoporosis. In 2021, osteoporosis was predicted to affect 18.3% of persons globally. Hence, the demand for estrogen receptor agonist is on boost. Moreover, the drug raloxifene is the most common drug used for the treatment of osteoporosis approved by the FDA. Moreover, osteoporosis in postmenopausal women could be prevented and treated with raloxifene. It belongs to a class of medications known as estrogen agonists/antagonists that have been created to deliver the advantageous effects of estrogens without all of the potential negative effects. Neither estrogen nor a hormone, it is neither. A selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) is another name for raloxifene.

Moreover, PCOS could also be treated with estrogen receptor agonist. PCOS has a severe negative effect on women, leading to irregular periods and acne. Consequently, it needs to be treated. Oral contraceptives (OCs; with combined estrogen and progestin) are thus the most frequently utilized type of drug to manage menstrual cycles in PCOS patients. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global estrogen receptor agonist market are: 

***Growth Drivers:***

- Rise in the Application of Estrogen in Asthma 
- Surge in Geriatric Population 

***Challenges:***

Some of the partial agonists have estrogen agonist effects on the endometrium, causing aberrant cell proliferation. This may show up as a rise in endometrial thickness, endometrial polyps, leiomyomas, or even endometrial cancer. Moreover, large studies have shown a rise in the risk of thromboembolic events, including pulmonary embolism. Additionally, in many other studies, it was observed that it could also cause stroke. Hence, this is estimated to hinder the growth of the market. Furthermore, research is still being carried out on the potential benefits of using estrogen receptor agonists as a new kind of treatment for a variety of disorders. Consequently, there are not a large number of people who are aware of this treatment. Additionally, there are not adequate professionals, particularly in rural areas, owing to its lack of popularity. Thus, it is expected that this factor would impede market expansion.

By indication type, the market for estrogen receptor agonist is segmented into cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, inflammatory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Amongst which, the cardiovascular diseases segment is poised to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035, owing to the growing cardiovascular cases worldwide. There is a lot of evidence to support the notion that estrogen affects cardiovascular physiology and function in both health and sickness, and that it may even act as a cardioprotective agent. 

By region, the Europe market for estrogen receptor agonist is projected to grow by the end of 2035. Rising government activities to raise public knowledge about estrogen receptor agonists and joint drug development are expected to have an impact on this market growth in this region. Also, the geriatric population in this region which would also contribute to the rise of the market. The older population is more vulnerable to a number of illnesses, including asthma, cardiovascular disease, and others. Consequently, it is poised that the market would expand in order to treat or stop the spread of disease.
