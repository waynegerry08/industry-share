The global adiponectin testing market is projected to grow at a CAGR of ~8% by attaining a noteworthy revenue during the forecast period, i.e., 2022 – 2031. Factors such as, rising cases of cardio metabolic diseases, and growing adoption of adipose-derived products are anticipated to provide the lucrative opportunity for the growth of the market over the forecast period. *For instance, it has been noticed that one out of 1,000 people has some sort of metabolic disease across the globe*. 

Additionally, by type, the global adiponectin testing market is segmented into ELISA, enzyme immunoassay, and others. Out of these sub-segments, the ELISA segment is anticipated to acquire the largest share in the market during the forecast period. The growth of the segment is ascribed to the higher utilization of ELISA to monitor the level of therapeutic drug level. Additionally, ELISA is also utilized to analyze and examine antibodies in the blood. Hence, all these factors are projected to propel the growth of the market over the forecast period. 

Furthermore, the global adiponectin testing market, by region, is bifurcated into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa region. Out of these regions, the market in the North America region is projected to grow at a noteworthy pace during the forecast period. The growth of the market in the region is attributed to the higher prevalence of metabolic diseases and the increasing obese population in the region. *Based on the data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that about 569,000 people die annually owing to heart diseases in the United States.*
