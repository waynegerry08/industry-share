Regionally, the global umbrella market is segmented into five major regions including North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East & Africa regions. Among these regions, the North America umbrella market is projected to grab the largest market share by the end of the forecast period primarily on account of the increasing trade of umbrellas in the United States. *The International Trade Center, in one of its statistics, stated that the imports of umbrellas in the United States peaked to USD 553,451 thousand in the year 2019 from USD 440, 625 thousand in the year 2010.*

***Growing Concern for Skin Cancer and Rising Popularity for Designer Umbrellas to Drive the Market Growth***

*The World Health Organization (WHO) in one of its statistics stated that around 132,000 melanoma skin cancers* *and in-between two and three million non-melanoma skin cancers occur every year around the world.*

The harmful UV radiation from the sun causes skin cancer in human beings. Owing to the dynamic change in weather conditions, backed by factors such as global warming and others, there is a rising need amongst individuals for always carrying an umbrella with them. Umbrella saves an individual from the scorching heat of the sun and also prevents the skin from getting affected by the harmful UV radiations. On the other hand, umbrella manufacturers are adapting to the use of chemically advanced materials in the fabric of the canopy of the umbrella or other parts of an umbrella, which is allowing umbrella designers to design different types of umbrellas for various end use purposes. Such factors are anticipated to drive the growth of the global umbrella market during the forecast period.

However, concerns for the presence of numerous unorganized players, who offer umbrellas at a very low price, thereby hampering the profitability of the key players of umbrella, are some of the factors anticipated to restrain the market growth.
