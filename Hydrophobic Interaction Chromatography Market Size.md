**Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography Market Size** 

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/hydrophobic-interaction-chromatography-market/5000): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2035”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global hydrophobic interaction chromatography market in terms of market segmentation by sample, product & services, end user, and by region.

***Rising Demand for Monoclonal Antibodies to Promote Global Market Share of Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography***

The global hydrophobic interaction chromatography market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the rising demand for vaccination for viral diseases and higher approvals of monoclonal antibodies. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography is utilized for analysis and ultimate purification and is an important aspect of the development of Mabs. More than 570 therapeutic mAbs have been explored in clinical trials by commercial firms around the world, and the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has licensed and is now marketing 79 therapeutic mAbs. Other than monoclonal antibodies, the development of vaccines also utilizes the HIC. All around the world, over 30 vaccines have been approved. IC is used to remove the host cell protein because host cells can contaminate the final vaccine product during viral vaccine manufacturing. It ensures the quality and efficacy of final vaccine compositions.

Besides this, a rise in spending on biopharmaceutical research, development, and manufacturing results in a greater production of novel drugs and therapies which in turn drive the market growth. In 2021, the 15 largest pharmaceutical corporations in the United States spent around USD 133 billion in R&D, a 44% increase over 2016. During the development of these medications, HIC isolates the target compounds from complex mixtures and assists them in meeting regulatory standards.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global hydrophobic interaction chromatography market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Surging Demand for Monoclonal Antibodies
- Rising Cases of Cancer

***Challenges:***

Lack of skilled researchers and slow adoption of technology in developing countries are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Chromatography is a technical process and requires technicians and researchers for carrying out the procedure effectively. On the other hand, the hydrophobic interaction chromatography is expensive. HIC has a number of expensive components, such as chromatography columns, detectors, and systems. Furthermore, other consumables such as resin and buffers might add to the overall cost. As a result, all of these expenses, particularly for a small business, are likely to stifle market growth.

By sample, the global hydrophobic interaction chromatography market is segmented into monoclonal antibodies, and vaccines. The monoclonal antibodies segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth of the segment is attributed to higher number of people suffering from cancer, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders, and Alzheimer's disease. All of these disorders have raised the demand for monoclonal antibodies, and growing mAB approvals will fuel segment growth. For example, in 2022, the FDA gave bebtelovimab, a new monoclonal antibody for the treatment of COVID-19, an emergency use authorization (EUA). HIC aids in the separation and identification of monoclonal antibodies, which exist in many isoforms with varied hydrophobic characteristics. This data provided by HIC can be used to evaluate the stability and consistency of the mAB products.

By region, the North American hydrophobic interaction chromatography market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. Cancer and autoimmune disease cases are expected to fuel market expansion. In 2022, the United States had almost 1,918,030 new cancer cases and nearly 609,360 cancer deaths. Monoclonal antibodies are extensively used in cancer therapy. HIC enables the synthesis of high-purity mAB, which is used in cancer therapy. Furthermore, rising expenditure and development of the healthcare system and the presence of leading pharmaceutical companies are also expected to drive market growth in the region.
