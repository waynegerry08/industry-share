Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Automated Optical Inspection Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/automated-optical-inspection-market/5527): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global automated optical inspection systems market in terms of market segmentation by component, type, application, technology, industry, and by region. 

***Growing Use of Electric Components to Promote Global Market Share of Automated Optical Inspection Systems***

The growth of the market is due to industry 4.0 concepts being integrated, resulting in increased connectivity and data-driven insights in AOI. For instance, spending on the Internet of Things (IoT) in Europe surpassed USD 202 billion in 2021, according to the International Data Corporation's (IDC) Worldwide Semiannual Internet of Things Expenditure Guide. Through 2025, it is anticipated to rise at a double-digit rate. According to projections the global annual generation of data is expected to surpass 180 trillion gigabytes by 2025. The industries that are enabled by IIoT will produce most of this. In addition, AOI systems enable real-time error identification, guaranteeing the preservation of the product's quality. These systems can also give the operator feedback based on previous data and production statistics, which helps to streamline the manufacturing process and reduce expenses related to labor, supplies, and time. These factors should encourage market expansion and increase the use of AOI systems in the industrial sectors.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global automated optical inspection systems market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Surge in Requirement for AOI Systems to Examine IC Substrates
- Rising Process of Miniaturization of Printed Circuit Boards and Electrical Components*** 

***Challenges:***

The most important consideration for image-based AOI systems is false calls. Several images are used by the image-based AOI system to distinguish between good and defective components. Nevertheless, the operator who takes these pictures and enters them into the database is primarily responsible for this system. It is occasionally possible for incorrectly identified photographs to be added to the image database, rendering parameter optimization unfeasible. Superior inspection technology and high cost are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of automated optical inspection systems.

By industry, the global automated optical inspection systems market is segmented into consumer electronics, IT & telecommunications, automotive, medical devices, aerospace & defense, industrial electronics, and energy & power. The automotive segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. An increase in the need for reliable and efficient electrical parts that boost vehicle safety is driving the segment’s growth in the market. In addition, the advent of technologies such as autonomous and electric vehicle technology, as well as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and anti-lock braking systems (ABS), has increased the need for high-end electronics components in the automotive industry. Germany, France, and Japan are leading the way in the automotive industry's adoption of AOI systems due to the presence of multiple major automakers in these countries. In 2022, almost 85 million cars were made worldwide. This is an increase of about six percent from the previous year. China, Japan, and Germany were the top three producers of automobiles and commercial vehicles in 2022.

By region, the Europe automated optical inspection systems market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. Because there are many automakers in Europe, it is expected that the AOI market will grow consistently. Automakers in countries like Germany and France are trying to make their cars safer, which means there is a greater need for high-quality electronic parts and, as a result, AOI systems in this field. AI-powered AOI technology is being used by an increasing number of German companies to ensure the quality and dependability of their output. Furthermore, the focus on Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing techniques will propel the German market for AOI systems forward. Germany is actively implementing Industry 4.0 concepts, and AOI and other sophisticated inspection technologies are part of this integration. The development of AOI systems has been facilitated by the shift to digital transformation and smart manufacturing.
