***Growing Population to Promote Global Market Share of Point-of-Entry Water Treatment Systems***

The global point-of-entry water treatment systems market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing population worldwide which is responsible for the expanding demand for uncontaminated water. Additionally, the rising urbanization and growing industrialization together with an increase in the share of commercial spaces are surging the need for clean water which is bolstering the adoption of water purification processes. 

Moreover, as the installation of water treatment plants at the point of entry makes a large volume of water fit for general usage and further treatment by removing dirt, sediments, and many chemicals, there is a huge expansion in demand for POE water treatment systems in large water treatment projects.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global point-of-entry water treatment systems market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Growing Demand for Drinking Water
- Increasing Efforts by the Government to Supply Clean Water

***Challenges:***

The high cost associated with the operations and maintenance of point-of-entry water treatment systems, and the lower penetration of such systems in small projects are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of point-of-entry water treatment systems.

By technology, the global point-of-entry water treatment systems market is segmented into water softening, filtration, reverse osmosis, disinfection, sedimentation, and distillation. The water softening segment is to garner the highest revenue by 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The segment is expected to grow faster due to rising demand for clean water and expanding efforts to treat hard water for use. 

By end-user, the global point-of-entry water treatment systems market is segmented into residential, commercial, and industrial. Amongst these segments, the industrial segment is forecasted to pool in major revenue owing to the implementation of stringent regulations on industries regarding the use and disposal of water.

By region, the Asia Pacific point-of-entry water treatment systems market is to generate the highest revenue by 2035. This expansion is anticipated due to rising water demand from a growing population, as well as a growing scarcity of safe water in emerging economies. Furthermore, government initiatives to promote sanitation and disinfection practices are expected to boost market growth in low- and middle-income countries. 

The North American point-of-entry water treatment systems market is projected to be the second-largest market by the end of 2035. The regional growth is backed by the rise in urban settlements and the increasing spread of waterborne diseases leading to a rise in demand for usable water. 

Further, the market in the Middle East and Africa is projected to hold a substantial share by 2035, driven by the increasing investment in water and the application of technology to create sustainable water solutions owing to its scarcity in the region, which is increasing the demand for such systems.
