By raw materials, the global dietary fibers market is segmented into fruits & vegetables, nuts & seeds, and cereals & grains. Among these segments, the cereals & grains segment is expected to garner a significant share in the year 2035. The growth of the segment is expected on account of increased consumption of fiber from cereals and grains owing to its easy availability, cost-effectiveness, and other benefits above others. Moreover, the rising production of cereals around the world is another factor for segment growth during the forecast period. Intake of fiber from cereal foods is the highest in the globe, supplying around 32 to 49% of the total in the United States and Europe, respectively. Moreover, around 89% of all cereal production globally is made up of wheat, rice, and maize.

By region, the North American dietary fibers market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by increasing awareness about health and rising cases of chronic diseases in the region. Every sixth adult in America, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has a chronic illness. In addition, 4 out of 10 adults have two or more chronic conditions. Furthermore, since the pandemic started, about 7 in 10 people are more conscious of how they treat their bodies.
