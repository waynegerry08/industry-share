***Growing Need for Electric Vehicles to Promote Global Market Share of Brushless DC Motor***

The global brushless DC motor market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing demand for electric vehicles around the world. For instance, brushless DC motors are used in the propulsion system of electric cars therefore, their popularity is raising the demand for these motors. Further, the global shift towards renewable energy sources and the desire for greener transportation is also driving the adoption of electric vehicles, resulting in the growing demand for brushless DC motors. *Sales of electric vehicles (EVs) are predicted to reach over 60 million units yearly by 2050, with a global EV stock of over 650 million.*

The global brushless DC motor market is estimated to grow majorly on account of growing urbanization. As cities become more crowded people have started looking for more effective and environmentally friendly solutions, thus increasing urbanization around the world is boosting the demand for brushless DC motors. *By 2045, more than 5 billion more people will live in metropolitan areas worldwide.*

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global brushless DC motor market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

· Rising Aerospace Sector

· Growing Technological Advancements

***Challenges:***

The high cost of brushless DC motors and the presence of inexpensive motors are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of brushless DC motors. One of the key elements projected to impede the market's growth is the high price of brushless DC motors. For instance, specialized electronic control systems with sensors, controllers, and power electronics are required for brushless DC motors to operate properly. The price of these components might raise the motor's overall cost.
