**Cryopreservation Cell Lines Market Share** 

Research Nester published a report titled **“[Cryopreservation Cell Lines Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/cryopreservation-cell-lines-market/4155): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2031”** which delivers detailed overview of the global cryopreservation cell lines market in terms of market segmentation by product type, end user and by region.

Further, for the in-depth analysis, the report encompasses the industry growth indicators, restraints, supply and demand risk, along with detailed discussion on current and future market trends that are associated with the growth of the market.

The global cryopreservation cell lines market is projected to grow with a significant CAGR during the forecast period, i.e., 2022-2031, on account of the robust research activities for developing clinical and commercial cell therapy and drugs for better disease treatment. Moreover, the availability of advanced products in the market is anticipated to boost the demand for cell cryopreservation. *For instance, in March 2018, BioLife Solutions Inc. announced that its cGMP CryoStor cell freeze media was reported in the journal Laboratory Investigation. CryoStor was superior compared to a traditional DMSO-containing home-brew freeze media cocktail in multiple comparisons of preservation efficacy of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors.*

The market is segmented by product type into cryoprotectant agents, cryogenic freezers, and others. Among these segments, the cryoprotectant agents segment is anticipated to hold the largest share in the global cryopreservation cell lines market owing to the rising number of government initiatives and investments for the preservation of cells coupled with growing pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical sectors. Glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are some of the most used cryoprotectant agents in cell banking applications. 

On the basis of region, the market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa, out of which the cryopreservation cell lines market in the Asia Pacific is projected to grow at the highest CAGR throughout the forecast period. Currently, the market in North America holds the largest share. This can be attributed to the presence of the most developed cryopreservation technology, accompanied by the presence of leading regional healthcare market players. In addition, an increase in healthcare expenditure, a rise in R&D activities, and the launch of novel and innovative products are some factors that are anticipated to boost the market growth for cryopreservation cell lines in the region.

The research is global in nature and covers detailed analysis on the market in North America (U.S., Canada), Europe (U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Hungary, Belgium, Netherlands & Luxembourg, NORDIC [Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark], Poland, Turkey, Russia, Rest of Europe), Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Rest of Latin America), Asia-Pacific (China, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Rest of Asia-Pacific), Middle East and Africa (Israel, GCC [Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman], North Africa, South Africa, Rest of Middle East and Africa). In addition, analysis comprising market size, Y-O-Y growth & opportunity analysis, market players’ competitive study, investment opportunities, demand for future outlook etc. has also been covered and displayed in the research report.

***Increased R&D Investments and Launch of Novel and Innovative Products to Drive Market Growth***

*The International Space Station Researchers in May 2021, explored new ways to culture living heart cells for microgravity research. According to the research, it was found that cryopreservation is the easiest way to transport these cells to the orbiting lab, which provides more flexibility in launch and operations schedules.* On the other hand, rising focus of companies on developing novel products for preserving various cells is also anticipated to boost the market growth during the forecast period. *For instance, in December 2021, BlueCube Bio, Inc. (Evia Bio) announced the launch of a significant new cryopreservation technology for use in gene and cell therapies utilizing Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs). The latest addition expands the company's portfolio of patented cryopreservation products that include mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) products.*

However, high maintenance cost of the media for cell storage is expected to operate as key restraint to the growth of global cryopreservation cell lines market over the forecast period.
