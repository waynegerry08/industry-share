***Rising Research and Development Activities to Drive Growth of Global Neuromarketing Solutions Market***

The global neuromarketing solutions market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the advent and proliferation of neuromarketing techniques, which has promoted investments in the field of digital advertising. On the other hand, businesses worldwide are increasingly working on developing advanced tools for analyzing viewability rate on digital screens. These analyses help businesses to promote their advertisements in an efficient manner and thus generate more business. *For instance, it has been observed that emotional expressions lead to a 29% higher viewability rate on digital screens and slightly greater consumer impact.*

Furthermore, neuroscience enables marketing companies and research firms to concentrate on the innovation and customization of their products and services to meet the needs of their customers. The rising awareness about the potential advantages of neuroscience techniques is further driving the adoption of multiple neuromarketing solutions at a rapid pace. In addition, automotive industry uses neuromarketing solutions to grasp the basic understanding of human's response to vehicles based on color, size, advertisement, brand perception, so that manufacturers could be able to modify, adapt as per the choices of consumers, and devise a clever marketing strategy based on the data gathered by different neuromarketing solutions.

However, the rising concern for high cost of neuromarketing solutions, and the stringent regulations developed by the government of nations worldwide are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the growth of the global neuromarketing solutions market. Regardless of the benefits of neuromarketing, the market is hampered by regulatory policies imposed by the government and governing bodies regarding the widespread use of neuroscience technologies. Europe and the United States are expected to face harsh criticism from data-protection authorities and consumer-protection organizations. Furthermore, as the use of neuromarketing grows, global regulatory authorities have turned their attention to it. These authorities believe that these techniques have been critical in misleading consumers' purchasing behavior, as consumers tend to make conscious decisions because they are monitored while making the decisions. As a result, stringent regulatory policy issues are expected to impede the global neuromarketing solutions market during the forecast period.

By technology, the global neuromarketing solutions market is segmented into functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), biometrics, facial coding, and eye tracking. The eye tracking segment is to garner a highest revenue of USD 1663.32 Million by the end of 2035 by growing at a CAGR of 10.13 percent over the forecast period.  The growth of the segment can be attributed to the increasing adoption of eye tracking and facial coding technology in gaming industry in the market. Moreover, eye tracking is also used by retail and consumer product companies to measure what their customers are looking at more precisely, which is expected to expand the growth of the eye tracking segment in the market. In addition, eye tracking will be highest growing segment owing to rising need for neuroscience research by brands to analyze the consumer's response towards advertising campaigns.

By region, the North America neuromarketing solutions market is to generate the highest revenue of USD 1,555.21 Million by the end of 2035.
