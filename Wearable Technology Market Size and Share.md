***A Growing Use Of Wearable Technologies In A Variety Of End-Use Industries, Such As Healthcare, Military, Defense, And Enhanced Fabrics (E-Textiles).*** 

Wearable technologies are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to track and monitor health and fitness data, as well as provide real-time feedback and data analysis. They are also used in the military and defense industries to provide soldiers and law enforcement personnel with enhanced situational awareness and communication capabilities. The wearable device worn by soldiers enables them to have better field awareness, as they will be able to access real-time data on the location of enemies, drones, and other targets in the vicinity. The device will also allow for more effective communication between soldiers, which will improve their ability to plan and execute missions effectively. Soldiers wear a wide variety of wearables, including thin and flexible heaters, biometric sensors for health monitoring, tracking devices, warming jackets, IR shielding uniforms, conductive textiles, and helmet mount display systems (HMDS). In addition, e-textiles are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to provide comfort, performance, and protection to the wearer.
