Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global IV disinfecting caps market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

· Surge in Elderly Population Globally

· Rising Investment in Healthcare

***Challenges:***

The rising concern for risks of not securing the sterile cap, and the absence of knowledge regarding the usage of disinfectant caps in developing countries are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of IV disinfecting caps. *For instance, the sterile cap's job is to act as a barrier against pathogens such as bacteria and viruses so they can't enter the IV line. If the cap is not tightly fastened, the IV line may contract an infection.*

By end-user, the global IV disinfecting caps market is segmented into hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic centers. The hospitals segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth of the segment can be attributed to the growing number of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). For instance, the increase in infections contracted in hospitals may lead to a greater requirement for IV disinfecting caps. Infections that patients contract while residing in a hospital or other healthcare facility are referred to as hospital-acquired infections. Also, medical professionals are concentrating on infection prevention strategies to protect patients from potentially fatal infections, which could increase demand for IV disinfecting caps. Moreover, IV cleaning caps are used to stop infections from spreading through intravenous lines. *Over 1 million infections and over 90,000 fatalities are attributed to healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) each year in hospitals in the US.*
