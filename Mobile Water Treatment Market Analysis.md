***Increasing Water Pollution to Drive Growth of the Global Mobile Water Treatment* *Market***

The global water crisis is the main factor driving up demand for mobile water treatment technology. As a result of urbanization, industry, and population growth, there is a decrease in the supply of clean, safe water. According to UNESCO, severe water scarcity affects over two thirds of the world's population for at least one month out of the year. Over two billion people live in countries with inadequate water resources, and by 2030, half of all people on Earth might be living in water-scarce regions. There may have been 700 million people displaced from their homes as a result of acute water scarcity. Moreover, by 2040, nearly one in four children worldwide would live in areas experiencing acute water scarcity.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global mobile water treatment** Market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Surging Water Pollution Levels
- Increasing Water Scarcity* 

***Challenges:***

It is difficult to deploy and set up mobile water treatment equipment in rural areas due to inadequate infrastructure. Rough terrain, limited access routes, and logistical difficulties can all significantly increase implementation costs and delays. Alternative solutions, such as solar panels or generators, are required in rural places because trustworthy power sources are often scarce there. This increases the difficulty of maintaining and operating the units, increasing dependency on outside resources. The deployment complexities in remote areas is expected to hamper the market growth.

The global mobile water treatment** market is segmented into water source, system type, service, technology, end use, where water source is sub-segmented into raw water and residual water. By the end of 2036, the raw water segment is anticipated to garner the largest revenue of USD 2.74 billion with a CAGR of 10.3% over the forecast period. Traditional freshwater supplies are getting harder to come by due to population growth, careless water management techniques, and climate change. Raw water treatment offers a practical solution by enabling the use of uncommon or yet undiscovered water sources, such as brackish water and even seawater. Advances in membrane technology, notably in the areas of high-rejection and reverse osmosis membranes, are contributing to an increase in the efficacy and efficiency of treating raw water. This permits the removal of a greater variety of contaminants and pathogens, making previously unsuitable water sources acceptable for drinking, irrigation, and other applications.

Over the forecast period of 2024-2036, the Asia Pacific mobile water treatment** market is predicted to develop at a CAGR of 11.1%. The European market was worth USD 66.7 million in 2023, and it is expected to be worth USD 262.6 million by the end of 2035. Over the course of the forecast period, the Asia Pacific water treatment systems market is expected to rise at a significant CAGR. Due to their developing economies, growing urbanization, and water scarcity, China, India, and the ASEAN countries are the main drivers of the need for water treatment systems in the region. and these nations. The expanding populace offers a sizable consumer market in the region. These businesses are expanding as a result of rising remittances, population growth, economic expansion, and greater investments from the public and private sectors. Approximately 75% of the water in Asia and the Pacific is unstable, and over 90% of the people living there are already facing an impending water catastrophe.
