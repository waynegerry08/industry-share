**Scleral Lens Market Growth & Analysis**

Research Nester Analytics LLC ’s recent market research analysis on **“[Scleral Lens Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/scleral-lens-market/4449): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2035”** delivers a detailed competitor’s analysis and a detailed overview of the global scleral lens market in terms of segmentation by type, application, and by region

***Increasing Prevalence of Ocular Diseases to Drive Growth of the Global Scleral Lens* *Market***

The rising prevalence of visual issues including keratoconus and dry eye syndrome has contributed to the increased demand for scleral lenses in several nations, which is expected to fuel market expansion. Because they provide superior comfort, stability, and visual acuity over standard contact lenses, these lenses are a preferred choice for those with challenging corneal conditions across a range of age groups. Between 50 and 200 persons per 100,000 are affected by keratoconus. 

In addition, the usage of contact lenses, particularly scleral lenses, has expanded globally as a result of the development of cutting-edge materials and designs including silicone hydrogel lenses and orthokeratology. The market has grown and patient needs have been met by the introduction of specialist scleral lens designs, such as those for irregular cornea management and myopia management. Scleral lens prescriptions accounted for more than 2% of the entire contact lens market in 2021, according to the Annual Market Share Review of the Contact Lens Spectrum. The market share of scleral lenses, or gas permeable (GP) lenses, grew from 14% in 2021 to 21% in 2022.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global scleral lens** market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Surging Aging Population
- New Developments in Therapeutic Uses* 

***Challenges:***

Misunderstandings about scleral lenses and inadequate patient knowledge may potentially prevent the industry from growing. If patients are not aware of the benefits and potential applications of scleral lenses, they may not actively request or look for them as a therapy alternative. The market for scleral lenses must be increased through patient education and awareness campaigns. In an effort to overcome these limitations, groups like the Scleral Lens Education Society (SLS) provide eye care professionals with knowledge and instruction regarding the fitting and management of scleral lenses. The insufficient patient knowledge & awareness is expected to hamper the market growth.

The global scleral lens** market is segmented into type and application, where type is sub-segmented into mini-scleral lenses, corneo-scleral lenses and semi-scleral, full-scleral lenses. By the end of 2035, the full-scleral lenses segment is anticipated to garner the largest revenue of USD 0.35 billion with a CAGR of 7.89% over the forecast period. The largest variation of scleral lenses is the full scleral lens. It offers the maximum coverage from the cornea to the lens's back surface. In cases of severe ocular disease, excessive dry eyes, or advanced keratoconus, a full scleral lens is used. If your cornea is extremely uneven, your best option is the Full Sclera lens. Conventional contact lenses and eyeglasses often fail to restore visual acuity (irregularity) in cases of corneal injury or distortion. The sclera, or larger lenses, cover the cornea. It is supported by the sclera, or white portion of the eye. The cornea is covered with a wet bed. This provides excellent comfort and vision. According to the World Health Organization, 1.9 million people roughly 5% of all blind patients have corneal opacification, which causes them to go blind.
