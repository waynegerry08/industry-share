***Increasing Awareness Regarding Harmful Effects of UV Rays to Boost the Market Growth***

UV or ultraviolet radiations cause photooxidative degradation in polymers, which reduces the life and strength of the material. UV stabilizers can reduce the effect of UV rays by absorbing or deflecting the radiations. The increasing use of UV stabilizers as additives in polymers is estimated to boost the market growth. Furthermore, the demand for UV resistant furniture and packaging materials in the construction and packaging industries respectively, is anticipated to encourage the market growth.

However, fluctuation in raw material prices expected to operate as key restraint to the growth of global UV stabilizers market over the forecast period.
