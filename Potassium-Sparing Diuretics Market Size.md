The global potassium-sparing diuretics market is projected to grow with a moderate CAGR during the forecast period, i.e., 2023-2035 on account of the rise in incidence of metabolic disorders worldwide** and its use to supplement the potassium loss caused due to the use of other diuretics. *As per the World Health Organization, it was assessed that in 2019, 1.13 billion people had hypertension globally, of which two-thirds of the population was living in low and middle-income regions*. Potassium-sparing diuretics are being accepted progressively for treatment owing to their capacity to reduce the fluids accumulated inside the body along with retaining potassium and thus, relaxing the blood vessels. Low serum potassium levels may lead to fluctuations in blood pressure, nerve and muscle functioning. Potassium-sparing diuretics control the discharge of potassium from the body, which plays a significant role in averting the development of various diseases caused due to potassium deficiency, such as hypertension.

The market is segmented by use into edema, hypertension, heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and others. Among these segments, the hypertension segment is anticipated to hold the largest share by the end of 2035 in the potassium-sparing diuretics market owing to the greater prevalence rate of hypertension globally as compared to other conditions. This high prevalence is due to the adverse changes in lifestyle and dietary patterns of the population. On the basis of distribution channel, the market is segmented into hospital pharmacies, retail pharmacies, online pharmacies, and others, out of which the hospital pharmacies’ segment is expected to grow significantly because a substantial share of the population with hypertension and related disorders prefer hospital facilities for treatment and that would contribute to the growth of hospital pharmacies.

On the basis of region, the market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa, out of which, the potassium-sparing diuretics market in the Asia Pacific is projected to grow at the highest CAGR throughout the forecast period owing to the rising incidence of hypertension-related medical conditions among the population in the region. Currently, the market in North America holds the largest share. This can be attributed to the presence of leading potassium-sparing diuretic providers in the region, especially in the United States, who are extensively involved in the improvement of end-user experience through their adoption of advanced technologies.

**Use of Potassium-Sparing Diuretics to Supplement the Potassium Loss Caused Due to the Use of Other Diuretics to Drive Market Growth**

*According to the data published by the World Health Organization in 2021, an estimated 17.9 million deaths are caused annually due to cardiovascular diseases in the world.* 

The growth in aging population and the changes in lifestyle patterns have given way to the prevalence of various cardiovascular, hepatic, and other related disorders among the population on a global scale which has steered the demand for diuretics. Additionally, the recently increasing use of potassium-sparing diuretics to maintain serum potassium levels in the body while using other diuretics is also expected to boost the market growth in upcoming years. 

However, the stringent regulatory procedures and harmful effects of the high potassium levels caused due to the use of potassium-sparing diuretics are some of the factors that are estimated to restrain market growth in the near future.
