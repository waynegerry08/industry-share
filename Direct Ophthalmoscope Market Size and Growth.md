***Growing Prevalence of Ocular Diseases such as Glaucoma, Corneal Opacification, and Others to Promote Global Market Share of Direct Ophthalmoscope***

The global direct ophthalmoscope market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increased cases of ocular diseases including glaucoma, corneal opacification, and others. For instance, these illnesses might impact the eyes, which necessitates the use of instruments such as direct ophthalmoscopes for medical personnel to monitor and examine. Moreover, direct ophthalmoscope aid in the management of numerous eye-related problems as well as provides a detailed evaluation of the retina, optic nerve, vasculature, and vitreous humor. Thus, the demand for direct ophthalmoscopes is anticipated to increase. *More than 590 million people globally reported having a distant vision impairment in 2020. It is anticipated that by 2050, there will be over 890 million people worldwide, 60 million of whom would go blind as a result of aging, population increase, and urbanization.*

The global direct ophthalmoscope market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the growing cases of diabetes around the world. Diabetes can result in eye conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, which can lead to blindness. This as a result increases the demand for direct ophthalmoscope equipment as it is used to detect and track the early signs of diabetes retinopathy. According to statistics, *around 640 million people will have diabetes worldwide by 2030, and by 2045, that number is projected to reach over 78 million.*

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global direct ophthalmoscope market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Growing Concern regarding Ophthalmological Health
- Rising Geriatric Population

***Challenges:***

The high cost of direct ophthalmoscopes and the lack of awareness about ocular disorders are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of direct ophthalmoscopes. One of the key elements projected to impede market expansion is the high price. Direct ophthalmoscopes are made with high-quality expensive materials. The entire cost of production may therefore rise as a result of this.

By application, the global direct ophthalmoscope market is segmented into glaucoma, retinal tear, and diabetes. The diabetes segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The reason behind the growth can be attributed to the increase in diabetes-related blindness cases. Diabetes patients often have damaged retinas, which can cause blindness. Since they aid in the early detection and diagnosis of the condition, this increases demand for direct ophthalmoscopes.

By region, the market in Europe is poised to hold a majority of the share by the end of 2035. The growth of the market can be driven by the growing elderly population in the region. For instance, elder people are more prone to chronic diseases such as diabetes, and other eye-related disorders such as cataracts, and glaucoma, which increases the demand for direct ophthalmoscope in the region as it is used for assessment of the eye and helps in providing quality treatment. For instance, Italy was reported to have the highest proportion of senior citizens in all of Europe in 2021.
