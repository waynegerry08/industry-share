***Surge in Demand for Renewable Energy to Boost the Growth of Global Gas Separation Membrane Market*** 

The global gas separation membrane market is set to grow on account of rising demand for renewable energy. The need for clean energy is rising due to worries about air quality, climate change, and environmental deterioration. Countries all across the world are embracing renewable energy sources including solar, wind, and hydroelectric electricity as nuclear and energy storage technologies progress. Therefore, it is anticipated that the requirement for gas separation membranes will increase. The role of modern membrane technology has been expanding rapidly in the last few years, and the way that it is applied in lieu of traditional separation technologies has been evolving. The membrane separation technique has several important benefits, including low energy consumption, small size, easy scaling, modularity, and so on. These benefits are especially important when conditioning and/or recovering gaseous and liquid energy carriers from different sources for use in renewable energy systems. 

Additionally, raw natural gas can have a very different composition depending on where the reservoir is found, although methane is typically the major ingredient along with various lighter and heavier hydrocarbons like propane and ethane. The gas contains hydrogen sulphide, water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and helium in varying concentrations. This raw natural gas needs to be processed in order to meet regulatory standards for calorific value and pipeline requirements. As a result, the use of gas separation membranes is increasing. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global gas separation membrane market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Rise in Improvement in Membrane 
- Surge in Use of Gas Separation Membrane in Food & Packaging Industry 

***Challenges:***

The field faces several obstacles concerning the commercialization and scalability of novel gas separation membranes. While researchers are always coming up with new membrane materials and topologies, there remains a barrier to bringing these ideas to the industrial level. These concepts have fascinating applications in the lab. It can be costly and time-consuming to move from lab or pilot-size membrane production to industrial scale membrane production. It is therefore very challenging to scale up without compromising quality or performance. Furthermore, it might take a substantial initial investment to improve membrane manufacturing. Costs will go up, larger manufacturing facilities will be constructed, and industrial equipment will be purchased. Maintaining economic viability while keeping these costs under control is a big task. 

By application, the market for gas separation membrane is segmented into nitrogen generation & oxygen enrichment, hydrogen recovery, carbon dioxide removal, and others. Out of these, the carbon dioxide removal segment is expected to capture the highest revenue of USD 1.68 Billion by the end of 2036. However, the nitrogen generation & oxygen enrichment segment is estimated to have significant growth in its revenue over the forecast period. For the chemical industry to recover reactants and separate desired products, methods for nitrogen production and oxygen enrichment are crucial. Systems for producing nitrogen- or oxygen-enriched air are made to order using gas separation membrane modules for usage in corporate and industrial settings. 

By region, the North America market for gas separation membrane is estimated to grow over the forecast period. The market in the region is expected to rise as a result of elements such as rising renewable energy demand, increased emphasis on efficiency in the oil and gas sector, and environmental laws.
