**Stem Cell Treatment Size and Growth**

**Global Stem Cell Treatment Market Size:**

The global [**stem cell treatment market**](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/stem-cell-treatment-market/1329) is estimated to grow at a CAGR of ~11% in the assessment period. The market is estimated to garner a revenue of ~USD 40 billion by the end of 2035, up from a revenue of ~USD 12 billion in the year 2022. Stem cell therapy, or regenerative medicine, promotes the repair response of diseased, dysfunctional, or injured tissue using stem cells or their derivatives. The growth of the market can be attributed to the rising demand for organ transplantation and the harsh reality that there are a limited number of organ donors and suppliers. In research for 2022, it was found that more than 100,000 Americans await organ transplants, and annually, nearly 6,000 die while waiting. Moreover, the rapid progress in the field of stem cells as well as the promising reports of clinical success stem cell treatment in various diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases and macular degeneration are expected to expand the stem cell treatment market.

**Global Stem Cell Treatment Market: Key Takeaways** 

- Market in North America to propel the highest growth
- Regenerative Medicine segment to garner the highest growth
- Market in Asia Pacific to grow at the highest rate 

**Growing Global Burden of Diseases to Boost Market Growth**

The global stem cell treatment market is anticipated to foresee exponential growth in the assessment period owing to the increasing spending on research & development (R&D), clinical trials, and approval for adult stem cell therapies, as well as education initiatives and patient advocacy in stem cell treatment across the world. The global widespread burden of various diseases and conditions like arthritis, autism, diabetes, leukemia, erectile dysfunction, infertility, lupus, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, HIV, heart diseases, Crohn's disease, vitiligo, epilepsy, neuropathy, breast cancer, sickle cell disease, Parkinson's, acne scars, migraines, hepatitis, Ataxia, eczema, and many more are expected to boost demand for affordable, advanced, and best stem cell treatment, leading to market growth. It is observed that the total cost of chronic disease alone in the United States amounts to ~USD 3.7 trillion each year, or 19.6 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP), inclusive of indirect costs associated with lost economic productivity.

**Global Stem Cell Treatment Market: Regional Overview**

The global stem cell treatment market is segmented into five major regions including North America, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa region. 

**Increasing Number of Trials to Drive Growth in the North American Region**

The stem cell treatment market in the North American region is estimated to garner the largest revenue by the end of 2035. The growth of the market in the region during the assessment period can be attributed to the presence of a developed healthcare infrastructure as well as the increasing number of clinical trials backed by the growing government funding for research on stem cell therapies. The United States (U.S.) administration provided ~USD 3.7 billion in 2001 for research on all forms of stem cells, including those from adult and other non-embryonic sources, and by 2019, one stem cell-based treatment had been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, used to treat patients with some types of cancer and disorders that affect the blood and immune system.

` `**Growing Medical Tourism to Drive Growth in the Asia-Pacific Region**

The stem cell treatment market in the Asia Pacific region is estimated to garner the highest CAGR by the end of 2035. The growth of the market in the region in the assessment period can be attributed to the vast pool of patients across the region suffering from a wide variety of medical conditions, including leukemia, thalassemia, damaged corneas, and several burns, as well as the augmenting medical tourism in emerging economies such as India, China, and other South Asian countries, besides the growing research investments by a few major market players in this field. As per findings, in India, the success rate of bone marrow transplants for blood cancer patients is almost 50%–75%, and for knee replacement stem cell therapy, it is around 100%. Moreover, stem cell treatment in India costs nearly 50% less than that in the USA, which is further expected to incite medical tourism in the region, boosting regional market growth.

The study further incorporates Y-O-Y growth, demand & supply and forecast future opportunity in:  

- North America (U.S., Canada)  
- Europe (U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Hungary, Belgium, Netherlands & Luxembourg, NORDIC [Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark], Poland, Turkey, Russia, Rest of Europe)  
- Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Rest of Latin America)  
- Asia-Pacific (China, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Rest of Asia-Pacific)  
- Middle East and Africa (Israel, GCC [Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman], North Africa, South Africa, Rest of Middle East and Africa). 

**Global Stem Cell Treatment Market, Segmentation by Application**

- <a name="_hlk128742803"></a>Regenerative Medicine
- Drug Discovery and Development

The regenerative medicine segment is anticipated to hold the largest revenue by the end of 2035. The segment growth in the assessment year can be attributed to the rapidly increasing technological advancements as well as growing investment in R&D by the pharma companies in developing regenerative medicine, along with the increasing success rate of stem cell transplants worldwide and a burgeoning number of clinical trials on cell therapies, immunomodulation therapy, and tissue engineering. According to research, stem cell transplants in India have a 50% success rate in treating various types of cancer, thalassemia, aplastic anemia, and more, while showing an approximately 70%–80% success rate in treating non-malignant conditions such as aplastic anemia.

**Global Stem Cell Treatment Market, Segmentation by** 

- Cell Acquisition
- Bone Marrow Harvest
- Umbilical Blood Cord
- Apheresis
- Cell Production
- Therapeutic Cloning
- In-vitro Fertilization
- Cell Culture
- Isolation
