The global autonomous delivery robots market is estimated to occupy a large amount of revenue by growing at a CAGR of <a name="_hlk91521038"></a>~49% during the forecast period, i.e., 2022 – 2031, ascribing to the rising affordability and return on investment on several infrastructure light robots, and high requirement for efficient automated deliveries in manufacturing units. Along with this, robust growth of the e-commerce industry, and emergence of deep learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision and robotic mechanics technologies are also expected to accelerate the growth of the market in the forthcoming years. 

The market is segmented by type, load carrying capacity and end user. Based on type, the fully autonomous robots segment is anticipated to acquire the largest share during the forecast period on the back of the ability of these robots to perform delivery operations effectively without the intervention of humans. Additionally, by end user, the retail & logistics segment is projected to grab the largest share over the forecast period attributing to the growing presence of e-commerce players and omnichannel retailers globally, as they are assessed to raise the demand for delivery robots for last mile delivery. 

Geographically, the global autonomous delivery robots market is segmented into five major regions, namely North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East & Africa. Asia Pacific is evaluated to witness noteworthy growth in the market during the forecast period, which can be attributed to the surging number of e-shoppers, and rise in number of startups working on autonomous delivery robots in the region. Moreover, the market in North America is assessed to acquire the largest share over the forecast period ascribing to the high penetration of delivery robots across end-user industries, such as hospitality and retail and, rising manufacturers and market vendors of these robots in the region.

***Rapid Growth of E-Commerce Industry Around the World to Expand Market***

With the rapidly growing e-commerce industry across the globe, the expectations of consumers for faster and frequent deliveries are also rising. But last mile deliveries are one of the biggest problems in handling the supply chain, which is giving impetus to the development of autonomous delivery robots as they are able to travel efficiently in difficult terrains as well. This in turn is anticipated to drive market growth significantly in the near future. 

However, less awareness about the product in lower economic regions is expected to operate as key restraint to the growth of the global autonomous delivery robots market over the forecast period.
