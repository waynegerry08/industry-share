The global dissolved acetylene gas market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of ~2.5% over the forecast period, i.e., 2022 – 2031. The market is segmented by end-user, into aerospace, shipbuilding, automotive, and others, out of which, the automotive segment is anticipated to hold a substantial share in the market over the forecast period. This can be accounted to the increasing application of dissolved acetylene for metal formulation, for manufacturing automobiles. Moreover, increasing sale of cars globally, is also anticipated to boost the market growth. *According to the data by the International Energy Agency (IEA), in 2019, 25 million cars were sold in China, 17 million in United States, 17 million in European Union, and 21 million cars were sold in the rest of the world.*

The global dissolved acetylene gas market is anticipated to witness growth on the back of increasing demand for liquid acetylene, as it is more stable for transportation and storage, as well as for usage. Acetylene gas independently can be highly unstable inside the cylinder, which can be hazardous for storage. Moreover, increasing use of dissolved acetylene gas for metal formulation is estimated to fuel the market growth, as it produces a high temperature flame on combustion with oxygen, which makes it suitable for welding metals. 

On the basis of geographical analysis, the global dissolved acetylene gas market is segmented into five major regions including North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East & Africa region. The market in the North America region is anticipated to gain the largest market share throughout the forecast period, on the back of increasing export and import of chemical substances in the developed region. *According to the data by the World Bank, chemicals added 15.804% value in manufacturing in the year 2019, in the United States.*
