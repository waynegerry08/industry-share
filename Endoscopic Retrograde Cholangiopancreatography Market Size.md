By end-user, the global endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography market is segmented into hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, and others. The hospitals segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth can be attributed to growing count of hospitals providing treatment for pancreatic diseases.

Endoscopes are vital for identifying and treating gastrointestinal diseases, and manufacturers are investing extensively in R&D to create technologically enhanced endoscopes. As a result, additional technological advances in endoscopy are being created, such as high-resolution video endoscopes and confocal laser end microscopy. 

By region, the Asia Pacific endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by higher cases of pancreatic and biliary diseases. As the prevalence of these disorders increases in the region, so will the demand for ERCP operations. For instance, ERCP is used to identify and treat a biliary tree or pancreatic duct disease by finding tumors or other abnormalities. In addition, the market in North America is set to hold the second largest share owing to the increasing elderly population who are prone to pancreatic and biliary disorders, and the growing popularity of advanced medical techniques. Further, the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography market in Europe is expected to hold a notable share on account of growing knowledge about gastrointestinal disorders. People are becoming more aware of the signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal diseases which results in timely diagnosis of the disease. This leads to higher demand for ERCP procedures in the region.
