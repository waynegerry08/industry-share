***Increasing Demand for Fertilizers in the Market to Promote Global Market Share of*** ***Ammonium Polyphosphate (Phase II)*** 

The global ammonium polyphosphate (phase II) market is estimated to grow majorly on account of demand for fertilizers in the market. Ammonium polyphosphate, which doubles as an emulsifier in food additives and as a fertilizer, is increasingly popular among farmers. The agricultural sector’s expansion has spiked the need for farm products, prompting farmers to enhance productivity and yield quality. To meet these goals, the application of ammonium polyphosphate is agriculture is critical. In 2021, a leading Asian country recorded a consumption of over 42 million metric tons of agricultural nutrients. Following this, India and Brazil were significant consumers, with figures standing 29.8 million tons and 21.7 million tons respectively. This uptick in nutrients use underlines a global trend towards intensified agricultural production to support growing demands.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global ammonium polyphosphate (phase II) market are: 

***Growth Drivers:***

- Increasing role as flame retardant, primarily utilized in industrial settings to increase safety against fire with combustible elements. 
- Ammonium polyphosphate (phase II) is a stable, non-reactive inorganic compound that withstands high temperatures and decomposes without producing harmful by-products. 

***Challenges:***

The toxic effects of ammonium polyphosphate are poised to impede market growth. This compound is increasingly used as a fertilizer in agricultural sectors worldwide, particularly in India. However, there is a growing concern over the potential harm to human health from frequent exposure. Public awareness of the risk associated with inorganic chemicals is on the rise, leading to growing aversion and a subsequent decrease in demand for ammonium polyphosphate. This shift could negatively impact the industry. Additionally, the market faces challenges from the availability of alternative flame-retardant material. These are the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of ammonium polyphosphate (phase II).

By application, the global ammonium polyphosphate (phase II) market is segmented into flame retardant, coating, painting.  The flame-retardant segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. Commonly frequent areas such as residence, workplace, and educational institutions are typically equipped with fire extinguishers. These extinguishers often contain monobasic ammonium phosphate, a key dry chemical powder component favored for its fire-suppressing properties. This substance effectively extinguishes fires by isolating the fuel from oxygen and enveloping the ignition sources. Particularly prevalent in domestic settings, these extinguishers are increasingly utilized for tackling electrical blazes and fires sparked by the grease, gasoline, or combustible material like timber. The effectiveness of portable fire extinguisher is notable, with a success rate of 94% in quenching fires usually within the initial two minutes of their deployment.   

By region, the Europe ammonium polyphosphate (phase II) market is to generate the significant boosting revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated by expanding consumption of global flame retardant which increased from approximately USD 4 billion in 2013 to an expected USD 5.2 billion, demonstrating the compounded consumption of around 5%. The European region is set to witness substantial development, spurred by environmental concerns, governmental incentives, and technological advancements. Highlighting opportunities in sectors such as polyurethane foams intumescent coatings, the analysis emphasizes the critical role of collaboration between the private sector and European governments in advancing supportive policies, research and market investments. Moreover, the increasing consumer demands and the broader context of rising global usage of flame retardants, the sector shows robust potential for expansion, reflecting the vibrant opportunities within the sector.
