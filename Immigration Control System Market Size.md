Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global immigration control system market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Surge in Security Concerns Owing to Territorial Conflict 
- Rising Global Trade leading to a High Number of Travelers Across the Globe

***Challenges:***

There are several drawbacks, including a lack of standardization in facial recognition and security risks for biometric data. This system was installed to ensure the security of border crossings. However, biometric technology needs to become more accurate and include multiple facial recognition algorithms. This lack of standardization leads to the creation of multiple face databases that provide as many variations of images as possible with different lighting, poses, facial expressions, and more so that the analysis of system performance and efficiency can cover situations with different environmental conditions.  Furthermore, the high cost of the system and the security challenges associated are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of the immigration control system.

By end user, the global immigration control system market is segmented into seaport, border, and airport. The airport segment is to garner a prominent revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The increase in air transport and passenger numbers has allowed airlines to handle a significant number of people at the same time. The increase in air travel is driven by, among other things, an increase in the number of people traveling abroad for higher education and job opportunities, a decrease in the cost of air travel, changes in the way people travel, and increases in transportation costs of rich wealthy people. Longer check-in times create overcrowding, forcing travelers to spend longer periods of time in lines. To prevent such bottlenecks, E-Gate technology is used. The need to efficiently transport people through airport checkpoints and increasing security concerns require the development of innovative technological solutions.

By region, the Europe immigration control system is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. Overall, the European market dominates the global market in terms of sales and this is likely to remain the same during the studied period. The proliferation of major companies and government support for automated border controls are important reasons to promote the development of the region's core population. The introduction of new threats such as terrorist activities and cyber-attacks has led to an increase in document theft and identity crimes. To address these challenges, changes are being made to international government regulations, resulting in new technological solutions being gradually rolled out across the region and driving market expansion in Europe.
