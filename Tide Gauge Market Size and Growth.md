**Tide Gauge Market Size and Growth**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Tide Gauge Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/tide-gauge-market/5062): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2035”** delivers a detailed competitor’s analysis and a detailed overview of the global tide gauge market in terms of market segmentation by application, type and by region. 

***Growth in Fishing Activities to Boost the Growth of the Global Tide Gauge Market*** 

The global tide gauge market is anticipated to grow on account of growth in fishing activities. One of the foods that is consumed regularly worldwide and whose popularity is only increasing is fish. As a result, there is a growing demand for tidal gauges. The tide has a significant impact on sea fishing. At some tides, some marks produce better fishing, while at others, access is impossible or even deadly. Therefore, the fishermen could safely and effectively conduct their activity under the guidance of the tide gauge.

Modern water level stations could measure 11 other oceanographic and meteorological characteristics, such as wind speed and direction, air and water temperature, and barometric pressure, in addition to more precisely recording tide heights. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) uses this data for a variety of purposes, including publishing annual tide predictions, recording and forecasting sea-level trends and other oceanographic conditions, and ensuring safe navigation. Hence, with the growing development in technology, the market demand is estimated to grow. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global tide gauge market are: 

***Growth Drivers:***

- Rising Prevalence of Tsunami 
- Growth in the Use of Tide Gauge in Coastal Engineering 

***Challenges:***

The information provided by the tide gauge may sometimes be wrong. This might be the result of technological improvement. According to estimates, tide gauges would be used with IoT, which would raise the risk of data theft and hacking. Even though it is intended that tidal gauges would only offer accurate information, inaccurate data may occasionally be recorded for several reasons, including instrument malfunctions, shipping incidents, storm damage, and everyday wear and tear. 

By application, the market for tide gauges is segmented into hydrographic charting, coastal engineering, offshore oil & gas, port & harbor management, and fishing industries. Out of these segments, the offshore oil & gas segment is anticipated to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035. The increasing need for oil and gas may promote this increase. However, the hydrographic segment is also estimated to grow. There is an increase in sea coast work which includes the construction of sea defense work, underwater excavation, and more. Hence, to carry out these tasks the need for hydrographic is growing further boosting the market growth.

By region, the market in Europe region for tide gauges is poised to grow over the forecast period. The sea level is an important environmental factor that significantly affects coastal inhabitants. Tide gauges are a key piece of equipment for analyzing trends in mean sea level, extreme weather (and how it relates to climate change), tidal computation, geodetic applications, harbor operations, and navigation, as well as sea level hazards warning systems (tsunamis and storm surges). The EuroGOOS tidal Gauge Task Team is bringing together the tidal gauge communities across the European and neighboring seas in response to the urgent and growing need for tide gauge data. Hence, owing to this the adoption of tidal gauges in this region is growing. 

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global tidal gauge market which includes company profiling of Kongsberg Maritime, Teledyne Reson, Atlas Elektronik, Seafloor Systems, Inc., Teledyne Odom Hydrographic, Iic Technologies, OHMEX Ltd, Thales, Raytheon Technologies Corporation, Fugro, and others.
