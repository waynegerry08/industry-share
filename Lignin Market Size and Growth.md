The market in Europe is also anticipated to garner notable share over the forecast period, owing to the rising demand for biopolymers backed by the initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions. 

***Rising Environment Awareness to boost the Lignin Market Growth***

There is a growing awareness globally regarding greenhouse gas emissions caused by high dependence on crude oil and its derivatives.  This has increased the demand for bio-based polymer products that are environmentally friendly, renewable and recyclable in nature. These shifting trends in the chemical manufacturing industry and increasing requirement of natural materials is projected to fuel the demand for lignin. 

However, Lignin is abundant in nature and therefore, is extremely low-cost, which creates a challenge for various end-user industries, as transportation of lignin costs much higher than the product itself. This is estimated to hamper the market growth
