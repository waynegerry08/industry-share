The market is segmented on the basis of end-user into hospital, ambulatory surgical center, specialty clinics, and others, out of which, the specialty clinics segment is anticipated to gain a notable share during the forecast period.

There are no permanent treatment methods to completely cure QPD. Blood platelet transfusion is repeatedly performed to provide the patient with functional platelets, which is not feasible for most of the patients. This is why, there is a massive demand to develop a new and more effective treatment for QPD. The growing R&D expenditure globally, is estimated to boost the market growth.

However, the high treatment cost is expected to operate as key restraint to the growth of global qualitative platelet disorders treatment market** over the forecast period.
