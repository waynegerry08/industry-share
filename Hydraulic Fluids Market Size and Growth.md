***Growing Oil & Gas Industry to Promote Global Market Share of Hydraulic Fluids***

The global hydraulic fluids market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing oil & gas sector. Hydraulic systems are heavily used in the oil and gas industries since oil and gas drilling are labor-intensive processes that rely heavily on hydraulic systems for energy and help in managing vast amounts of power*.* This may lead to a corresponding increase in the demand for hydraulic fluids as they are essential for the smooth operation of hydraulic systems.

*According to estimates, global crude oil output rose by over 5% in 2022.*

The global hydraulic fluids market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing demand in the aerospace & defense industry. Applications in the military and aerospace use a variety of hydraulic fluids since commercial and military aircraft both have hydraulic systems to operate the brakes, flaps, and landing gear which uses hydraulic fluids to aid mixed fleets in extending the life of these systems. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global hydraulic fluids market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Surge in Need for Heavy Equipment Globally
- Rising Generation of Crude Oil

***Challenges:***

The rising concern for the environment and supply chain disruptions are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of hydraulic fluids. Environmental harm from hydraulic oil leaks lasts for a long time and it is known that soil, groundwater, river water, and ocean can all be contaminated by hydraulic fluid spills made of petroleum, which could be harmful to people, plants, animals, and even marine life.

By base oil, the global hydraulic fluids market is segmented into mineral oil, bio-based oil, and synthetic oil. Out of which, the mineral oil segment is to garner the highest revenue over the forecast period. The growth can be attributed to growing industrialization across the globe. Hydraulic oils with a high viscosity index that are made of mineral oil are of the highest quality and are frequently used in industrial equipment to transmit power and lubricate moving parts in the machines.

*Global industrial production in 2023 increased by over 0.1%, excluding the United States.*

In addition, the synthetic oil segment is expected to gain a notable share of revenue on the account of benefits offered by this oil. Synthetic base oils are formulated from chemical compounds rather than crude oil which offer the advantage of better viscosity-temperature (VT) behavior. In addition, these oils are thinner at low temperatures and thicker at higher temperatures and have a lower coefficient of friction. Furthermore, hydraulic systems filled with these are easier to start, demonstrate smaller energy losses, as well as provide protection against corrosion and rust.

By region, the Asia Pacific hydraulic fluids market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by growing urbanization in countries such as India and China which has led to rapid economic development in the countries. This may increase the demand for hydraulic fluids in the region since urbanization drives infrastructure development which relies on hydraulic systems. *In 2021, urban areas were home to more than 35% of the population in India and over 60% of the population in China.*

In addition, the market in North America is estimated to hold the second-largest share on the account of growing demand for automation. This may increase the demand for hydraulic fluids since automated machinery use hydraulic systems that require hydraulic fluids to ensure the smooth functioning of these systems.

Further, the market in Europe may witness a huge demand for hydraulic fluids owing to the growing focus on sustainability and energy efficiency. This may increase the demand for sustainable hydraulic fluids for various industrial purposes.
