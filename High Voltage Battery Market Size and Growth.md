***Growing Sales of Electric Vehicles to Promote Global Market Share of High Voltage Battery***

The global high voltage battery market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the rising demand for electric vehicles followed by higher investment in the production of batteries. Introduction of new models, high oil costs, and targeted legislative support, sales of electric vehicles increased in every market. Battery-powered energy storage technology is necessary for hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles. The battery serves as a replacement for gasoline or diesel. In 2022, the number of electric car sales worldwide increased by around 60%, surpassing 10 million for the first time, up from 6.6 million in 2021. Furthermore, in order to create a new facility in the United States, LG Energy indicated that it will invest close to USD 5 billion. Production of batteries for electric vehicles is expected to begin there in 2025. In addition to this, BMW announced a USD 1 billion investment in a plan to increase battery production at a Chinese factory in the Lioning region of the country's northeastern part.

On the other hand, the rising need to curb the emission of greenhouse gases can increase the use of high-voltage batteries in vehicles and the demand for electric vehicles. Almost 75% of all CO2 emissions worldwide are brought on by the road, and Asian economies have increased this in recent years which was nearly 795 million tons of CO2. The transportation industry is responsible for one-fourth of all greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) linked to energy, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global high voltage battery market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Rise in the Capacity of Battery Facilities 
- Rising Need to Curb the Greenhouse Gas Emission

***Challenges:***

The absence of adequate factories for the manufacturing of batteries and a dearth of battery-powered vehicle charging stations are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of high voltage batteries. On the other hand, producing batteries uses a significant quantity of water. For instance, producing 1 ton of lithium uses close to 2 million tons of water. Additionally, even the effects of using batteries are not sustainable for the environment. Groundwater, surface water, and soil are all contaminated by chemicals released by battery deterioration. Our ecosystems, which are home to thousands of aquatic plants and animals, are at risk when poisoned by battery chemicals. Moreover, lead, cobalt, and other rare earth minerals are necessary as raw materials for the manufacture of batteries. They are taken out through mining, which has a negative effect on the region around the mine. Therefore, the negative impact imposed by battery production on the environment is likely to impede market growth.

By battery type, the global high voltage battery market is segmented into lithium-ion battery, lead-acid battery, aluminum air battery, and hydrogen battery. The lithium-ion battery segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The increased investment in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries might be considered a contributing factor in the segment's expansion. Over the next 21 years, it is predicted that various investments totaling more than USD 620 billion will likely finance the increasing capacity of lithium-ion batteries. The supply chain, material extraction, and material refinery are just a few of the different battery production processes that will be covered by this funding. Also, the growth of the segment was considerably influenced by the increased demand for lithium-ion batteries. Between 2020 and 2030, the battery's demand is predicted to increase by around 11 times, and its capacity is projected to exceed 2 terawatt-hours.

By region, the Asia Pacific high voltage battery market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. The market's expansion can be largely attributed to an increase in automotive sales. Over 27 million vehicles, including cars, lorries, and buses, were sold in China overall. In addition to this, the sale of electric cars in China increased by almost 10% in the same year. On the other hand, increasing investment to increase battery production and rising emissions of greenhouse gases from the transport sector are also responsible for the market expansion in the area. For instance, both the public and private sectors intend to invest USD 24 billion in order to implement the Japanese Commission's advice. Moreover, India contributes around 291 million tons of the 795 million tons of CO2 that are generated by Asian economies. Only the transportation sector's CO2 emissions have increased in the last ten years.
