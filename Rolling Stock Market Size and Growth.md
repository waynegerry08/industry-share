**Rolling Stock Market Size and Growth**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Rolling Stock Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/rolling-stock-market/4798): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2035”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global rolling stock market in terms of market segmentation by end use, type, product and by region. 

***Increasing Traffic Congestion and Carbon Dioxide Emissions to Promote Global Market Share of Rolling Stock***

The global rolling stock market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the growing concern related to the traffic congestion found in the busiest cities, leading to economic losses. *According to reported data, the average annual economic losses in US cities from traffic congestion amounted to USD 11.0 billion in New York and USD 7.6 billion in Chicago each year.* Moreover, the subsidies provided to the public transportation are attracting more people towards the public transport, which will reduce the use of personal vehicle to travel. Thus, it is anticipated to boost the growth of the global rolling stock in the upcoming years. 

Moreover, the increasing need for the reduction of the emission of carbon dioxide from the vehicles through the efficient use of energy is another factor that is expected to contribute to the growth of the market over the forecast period. In addition, rail is a form of transport that has more potential for mass transportation in order to fight against global warming.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global rolling stock market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Increasing Adoption of Automation in Rolling Stock
- Increasing Adoption of Public Transportation

***Challenges:***

The high capital requirements for the advancement, lack of advanced infrastructure for the rails, and inability to adjust timings of a rolling stock according to a particular person are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of rolling stock market. There is a requirement for large investment in the construction of rail infrastructure, and advancing the rail system with new technologies such as the adoption of big data, and robots in its operations. Moreover, the difficulty in working capital management for the operations is further anticipated to restrain the growth of the market over the forecast period. 

By type, the global rolling stock market is segmented into diesel, and electric. In 2035, the electric segment of the two categories of rolling stock is anticipated to have the biggest market share. The segment's expansion can be owing to the growing desire to choose an environmentally friendly choice that produces fewer carbon monoxide emissions than diesel rail. Also, the problem of global warming has been a major worry for various forms of transportation, and regulatory bodies are taking the required steps to reduce emissions. It is therefore projected that it will accelerate the segment's expansion in the area. For instance, freight trains use a lot more energy overall, with diesel accounting for around two thirds of all energy use worldwide in 2021. According to the International Energy Agency, under the Net Zero Scenario, further improvements in freight electrification will lower this percentage to about 40% by 2030. 

By the end of 2035, it is anticipated that Asia Pacific would have the greatest market share for rolling stock among all other regions, with a share of nearly 29%. The region's growing number of rolling stock producers can be largely attributed for the market's expansion. Another element that is anticipated to support the market's growth in the area is the increasing use of passenger rail for commuting. Another factor that is anticipated to contribute to the market's expansion in the area is the increased money allotted by the government for the development of the railway sector through metro projects and electrified network train routes. Furthermore, the market in the Middle East and Africa is also anticipated to grow at the second-fastest rate among all other markets by the end of 2035. The aspect that is anticipated to boost the rolling stock in the region is the soaring demand for constructing a sophisticated infrastructure of railway systems for moving items such as oil and diesel as well as passengers.
