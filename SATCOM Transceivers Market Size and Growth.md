The global SATCOM transceivers market is estimated to occupy a substantial revenue by growing at a CAGR of ~9% during the forecast period, i.e., 2023 – 2035, ascribing to the growing number of satellites launched in the last few years, and upsurge in demand for enhanced data communication worldwide. Along with these, escalating dispatch of satellites for applications such as weather pattern monitoring, remote sensing, agriculture monitoring and navigation is also expected to drive the growth of the market in the forthcoming years. 

The market is segmented by application and end user. Based on application, the communication segment is anticipated to occupy the largest share during the forecast period in view of the increasing need for high-speed data communication, which in turn is predicted to raise the use of satellite transceivers. Additionally, by end user, the government segment is projected to acquire the largest share over the forecast period attributing to the escalating focus of government agencies to launch satellites for earth observation and weather pattern monitoring. 

Geographically, the global SATCOM transceivers market is segmented into five major regions, namely North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East & Africa. North America is evaluated to gather the largest share in the market during the forecast period attributing to the rising launch of satellites for providing 5G internet connectivity, and strong presence of major market players in the region. Moreover, the market in Asia Pacific is assessed to witness noteworthy growth over the forecast period on the back of the growing investments in space programs, and escalating launch of satellites for scientific research & development in the region.
