Additionally, by resin type, the acrylic segment is set to garner a notable share during the forecast timeframe. Acrylic resins are homo- and co-polymers of alkyl acrylates and methacrylates which have become a sustainable choice for coating formulators owing to their features such as durability, low VOC, and rapid drying which makes them apt to be used in wide range of applications ranging from consumer items like as lenses to industrial uses.

By region, the North America coating resins market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated by the presence of extreme climatic conditions. The United States experiences more extreme weather from coast to coast, which includes heat waves, freezes, heavy downpours, tornadoes, tropical storms, and floods. For instance, in 2021, more than 43% of the contiguous United States experienced temperature, precipitation, or drought extremes. Therefore, several industries in the region employ coating resins they have proven to be an effective coating against severe weather conditions and the passage of time owing to their excellent weather, corrosion, chemical, and abrasion resistances. 

Besides this, the rising marine sector in the North American region has driven the market growth. For instance, waterways transport over 65% of all products exchanged in the United States. Moreover, coating resins are used to coat ships and their components, to create a long-lasting, corrosion-resistant barrier against the severe marine environment and provide various benefits such as weather resistance, improved look, and resistance to chemical solvents such as water and oils on ships.

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global coating resins market which includes company profiling of Allnex Netherlands BV, BASF SE, LANXESS, Koninklijke DSM N.V., The Dow Chemical Company, DIC Corporation, Bayer AG, Celanese Corporation, Eastman Chemical Company, and others.
