The global hydro turbine market is estimated to grow on the back of rising adoption of hydroelectricity, as a greener alternative to thermal power, which is generated from burning coal. Hydroelectricity is renewable, as the water used to rotate the turbine can be reused ever time. The growing construction of dams, and hydro powerplants in developed and developing nations, such as, United States, Brazil, China, India, and Canada, among others, is estimated to boost the market growth. Furthermore, government initiatives on reducing carbon footprint, and promoting hydroelectricity are further expected to fuel the growth of the market.

On the basis of region, the global hydro turbine market is segmented into five major regions including North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East & Africa region. The market in the Asia Pacific region is projected to grow at the highest CAGR over the forecast period, owing to the rising government initiative to promote hydroelectricity in countries, such as, India, and China, along with favorable landscape in the region. Presence of large rivers in this region, is also one of the factors driving the market growth.

The research was global in nature and conducted in North America (U.S., Canada), Europe (U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Hungary, Belgium, Netherlands & Luxembourg, NORDIC (Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark), Poland, Turkey, Russia, Rest of Europe), Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Rest of Latin America), Asia-Pacific (China, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Rest of Asia-Pacific), Middle East and Africa (Israel, GCC (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman), North Africa, South Africa, Rest of Middle East and Africa).
