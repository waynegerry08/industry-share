**Offshore Drilling Rigs Market Size and Share** 

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Offshore Drilling Rigs Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/offshore-drilling-market/4895): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global offshore drilling rigs market in terms of market segmentation by type, water depth, and by region. 

***Increasing Exploration Activities to Promote Global Market Share of Offshore Drilling Rigs***

As a result of the finding, there was an increase in the need for drilling and energy extraction due to the need to commercialize its use, which in turn increased the need for drilling rigs. The rise in exploratory activities taking place globally is another important factor boosting the need for drilling rigs. With an average discovery of more than 150 million barrels of oil equivalent, or about twice the average for the previous ten years, 2022 was a breakthrough year for the global oil and gas exploration sector.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global offshore drilling rigs market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Increasing Demand for Natural gas and Oil
- Increasing Production of Unconventional Oil and Gas 

***Challenges:***

A number of alternative energies are being greatly outpaced in terms of oil and gas use. Geothermal, solar, and wind energy are replacing the usage of oil and gas in space heating as well as transportation and energy production. This is especially true for water heating.

Some other factors such as fluctuating prices in the energy sector and the adverse impact of drilling the reserves on the environment may hamper the market growth of offshore drilling rigs.

By water depth, the global offshore drilling rigs market is segmented into shallow water and, deepwater and ultra-deepwater. Deepwater and ultra-deepwater areas contain significant untapped oil and gas potential. As onshore and shallow-water reserves run out, oil and gas businesses increasingly focus on discovering and exploiting hydrocarbon resources from these deepwater and ultra-deepwater locations. It increases the need for drilling rigs that can operate in such difficult circumstances. Governments and energy companies also invest money in offshore exploration and production to secure the future energy supply. Deepwater and ultra-deepwater regions are being actively explored and developed all over the world, including the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil's pre-salt reserves, West Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region. These expenditures have raised demand for deepwater and ultra-deepwater drilling rigs.

By region, the North America offshore drilling rigs market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. During the anticipated period, the market for offshore drilling rigs in North America is anticipated to have a share of 35%. The increase in demand for drilling rigs for oil extraction and subsequent maintenance is due to the increase in the amount of oil reserves. Both the US and Canada have discovered offshore oil and gas assets in the area. According to a research, approximately 75% of the world's oil reserves are in Canada, including its oil sands resources. The United States is home to one of the greatest oil shale reserves in the world. Both public and commercial entities are investing in offshore drilling to improve oil output in these regions since they have an abundance of energy resources.
