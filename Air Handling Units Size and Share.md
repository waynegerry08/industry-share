***Growing Adoption of IoT in Air Handling Units to Boost the Growth of the Global Air Handling Units Market*** 

The global market for air handling units is set to grow on account of growing adoption of IoT in air handling units. The effective operation of the system is thanks to IoT use in air handling units. Data collection, cloud storage, and maintenance scheduling have all been made simpler thanks to this technology. The use of IoT also makes system monitoring, control, and diagnosis more affordable. Due to the fact that it also offers data on how the AHU system is doing in the present. The additional maintenance expense is thereby decreased. For instance, loT-enabled structures may give facility managers early warnings of any technological irregularities and enable remote diagnostics and rectification, which might reduce system failures and save money. 

Additionally, increasing urbanization and population are two key variables that are anticipated to drive up demand for these goods and propel market expansion. Additionally, there is a substantial demand for these items due to an increase in construction-related activities around the world. Additionally, government programmes like the "Nation Programme on Strategies for Sustainable Smart Cities" and the "National Infrastructure Programme" for building new homes and businesses, such government programmes increase demand for air handler. The market's expansion is supported by a rise in end-user knowledge of the advantages of these systems, such as the maintenance of clean air in commercial and industrial environments, which will increase demand for these goods.
