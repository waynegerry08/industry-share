Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Green Data Center Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/green-data-center-market/5648): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global green data center market* in terms of market segmentation by component, industry vertical, enterprise size and by region. 

***Rising Demand for Data Storage and Growing Demand for Energy-Efficient Computing Systems to Promote Global Market Share of Green Data Center Market***

The global* green data center market* is estimated to grow majorly on account of rising demand for eco-friendly cloud computing techniques. In the research, it has been estimated that a typical large data center can generate almost 20 to 51 MW of heat. Other than this, researchers say that data transmission and data centers are responsible for almost 1% of energy related GHG (greenhouse gases) emissions. Other than this, the global data center electricity usage in the year 2021 was almost 220-321 Terawatt hours. Hence, to eliminate these factors, the market players are encouraging agencies and organizations to enhance data center energy efficiencies. As the cloud computing is required to be more energy efficient and increasingly relies on renewable sources, other industry verticals such as transportation, manufacturing, and buildings are projected to turn to green data centers to eliminate emissions. Other than this, the major vendors offering ECO modes in UPS to foster the adoption of the green data centers. The ECO mode is also known as economy and active standby is the most energy-efficient UPS operations mode. The corporate social responsibility is a prominent component of various business strategies for numerous companies. To eradicate, their reliance on non-renewable fossil fuels and green data centers utilizes renewable energy sources.
