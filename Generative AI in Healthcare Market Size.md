Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global generative AI in healthcare market are: 

***Growth Drivers:***

- *Generative AI plays an important role in drug repurposing by analyzing molecular interactions by* enhancing clinical trials and increasing the success of drug development.  
- AI in Healthcare offers substantial financial benefits by increasing revenue and reducing costs. 

***Challenges:***

For generative AI models to train effectively, they require datasets that are not only comprehensive and diverse but also of high quality. In the healthcare sector, obtaining such datasets is challenging due to the issues like bias, data fragmentation, and irregular data formats. These complications threaten to the performance and reliability of generative AI applications, with inaccuracies stemming from imperfect or prejudiced data. These integrity and efficacy of AI-driven solutions in healthcare could be compromised. Limiting their adoption and trust along medical professionals. Consequently, these issues are emerging as major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of generative AI in healthcare. 

By application, the global generative AI in healthcare market is segmented into clinical, system.  The clinical segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. This technology is revolutionizing areas such as oncology, infectious disease, dermatology, and heart care. In cardiology, for instance, it plays a pivotal role in fine-tuning diagnoses and personalizing treatment plans through advanced data analysis. Dermatologists are using AI for more accurate assessments and treatments suggestions by evaluating skin condition. Additionally, generative AI is crucial in swiftly identifying disease-causing agents, thereby, accelerating the response to infectious disease outbreaks. It also proves indispensable in oncology for genetic evaluations and developing customized treatment protocols, greatly enhancing clinical decision making. The importance of such advancements is underscored by the global health burden of cardiovascular diseases, which are top cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year. 

By region, the Europe generative AI in healthcare market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated by advancements in machine learning and deep learning, now specifically poised to revolutionize the European healthcare market. Generative AIs integration is expected to synthesize new drug compounds, enhance medical imaging, and personalized treatment plans, contributing to a broader range of 63 identified use cases across 16 business functions.   This could deliver an economic impact ranging from USD 3 trillion to 4 trillion annually across industries, marking a significant increase of 16 to 41% over the USD 12 trillion to USD 17 trillion potential value unlocked by non-generative AI and analytics. The promise of generative AI in improving diagnostic accuracy, patient care, and treatment innovation in Europe is vast, yet it comes with challenges such as data privacy and misinformation risks.
