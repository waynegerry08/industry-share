***Growing Demand for Eco-friendly Materials to Promote Global Market Share of Thermoplastic Ester Elastomer (TPEE)***

Environmental sustainability is becoming a bigger concern for both consumers and government regulators. Since TPEE is recyclable, it is a more environmentally friendly material than conventional materials like rubber or PVC. Furthermore, TPEE manufacture lowers the total carbon footprint of the production process by using less energy and emitting fewer greenhouse gases than other materials. Consumers' rising knowledge of environmental issues is fueling their preference for products made of sustainable materials. In reaction to this change in customer behavior, they are forced to embrace ecologically friendly materials like TPEE in order to meet market demands. Customers are starting to live more sustainably by adopting a completely zero-waste lifestyle, supporting businesses that practice environmental responsibility, and buying products manufactured from sustainable resources. For instance, between 2017 and 2022, the number of global Google searches for sustainable product-related topics climbed by over 130%.
