***Growing Incidences of Security Breach in Organizations Resulting in Data Loss to Boost Market Growth***

Cyber security breaches are growing continuously in both frequency and sophistication. Organizations are frequently falling victim to attacks leading to disruption in operation and losing significant revenue and reputation. Keeping up with the incredibly fast evolving cyber threats, organizations choose to shift to outsourced security resources to gain security expertise and lessen the expenditure. With organisations leveraging the flexibility of hybrid cloud benefits to create a unified security approach and manage their security strategy efficiently, demand for managed security services is increasing exponentially. These factors are majorly fostering the growth of the global managed security services market.

However, lack of capital resources in mostly SMEs, skilled IT professionals to handle challenging situations, and reluctance and trust issues on third-party applications to share sensitive data are expected to operate as barriers to the growth of global managed security services market over the forecast period.
