Further, for the in-depth analysis, the report encompasses the industry growth indicators, restraints, supply and demand risk, along with detailed discussion on current and future market trends that are associated with the growth of the market.

The global polycarbonate diols market is segmented by form into solid and liquid, out of which, the solid form segment is anticipated to hold the largest market share by the end of 2035. The growth of the segment can be attributed to the <a name="_hlk62732338"></a>increasing demand for waterborne coatings and paints, coupled with the increasing demand for high-performance synthetic leathers. Waterborne coatings and paints are used in the textile, automotive, and furniture industries as polycarbonate diols are highly resistive to hydrolysis, oxidation, and stain in polyurethane products.

The global polycarbonate diols market is estimated to garner a revenue of ~USD 503 Million by the end of 2035 by growing at a CAGR of ~6% over the forecast period, i.e., 2023 – 2035. Further, the market generated a revenue of ~USD 250 Million in the year 2022. Factors such as the increasing regulatory restrictions on solvent emissions and the awareness for the environment for waste disposal and factory vapor levels are raising the need for the use of water-based polyurethane materials instead of solvent-based materials, which in turn is raising the demand for polycarbonate diols. As polycarbonate diols possess resistive properties for hydrolysis, hence they find wide utilization in polyurethane materials

Regionally, the global polycarbonate diols market is segmented into five major regions including North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East & Africa regions, out of which, the Asia Pacific polycarbonate diols market is anticipated to grab the largest market share. The growth of the market in the region can be attributed to the presence of nations, such as China and India, where the consumption of polycarbonates is significantly high when compared to the world. Moreover, the growing demand for polycarbonates from the end-users who use polycarbonate diols for the manufacturing of different end-use products is also anticipated to drive the growth of the market in the region.

***Several Beneficial Attributes of Polycarbonate Diols to Help Expand the Growth of the Market***

Polycarbonate diols possess numerous beneficial properties as compared to other polyols. These chemical compounds have excellent hydrolytic stability and low water absorption and can withstand maximum temperature with low-temperature flexibility. Additionally, polycarbonate diols can withstand changing weather and are resistant to UV, chemicals, and oil. Owing to such favorable properties, they are used by manufacturers to manufacture various end-use products, ranging from polyurethane coatings, cast elastomer applications, and adhesives among others. Such a factor is anticipated to drive the growth of the global polycarbonate diols market during the forecast period.

However, concerns for the <a name="_hlk62732360"></a>presence of ecologically harmful compound bisphenol (BPA), which is known to cause health effects on the brain and prostate gland of infants, fetuses, and children, and to disrupt normal hormone levels in human beings, and cause diseases such as cancer, are some of the factors anticipated to limit the growth of the polycarbonate diols market during the forecast period.

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global polycarbonate diols market which includes company profiling of <a name="_hlk62732161"></a>Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (TYO: 4188), Chemwill Asia co., Ltd, GRR Fine Chem, Saudi Arabian Oil Co.
