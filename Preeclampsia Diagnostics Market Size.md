Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Preeclampsia Diagnostics Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/preeclampsia-diagnostics-market/4412): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2035”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global preeclampsia diagnostics systems market in terms of market segmentation by test type, product type, end-user, and by region. 

***Rising Popularity of Early Detection Screening Tests for Preeclampsia to Drive Growth of Global Preeclampsia Diagnostics Market***

The global preeclampsia diagnostics market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the globally rising cases of preeclampsia. For instance, preeclampsia now affects nearly 5% of all pregnancies worldwide. High blood pressure damages the arteries of the body by forcing the heart to work harder to pump blood. To keep track of high blood pressure during pregnancy, hypertension must be monitored on a regular basis. As a result, rising preeclampsia diagnoses are fueling the growth of the preeclampsia diagnostics market. Every year, 3 million mothers worldwide are affected by preeclampsia, which is linked to premature births and infant illnesses such as cerebral palsy, blindness, epilepsy, deafness, and lung conditions. Preeclampsia has no effective detection method, and the cause is unknown.  Hence, the requirement for earlier detection of the diseases is anticipated to boost the global preeclampsia diagnostics market.

The rising concern for lack of knowledge of the severity of preeclampsia in pregnancy and complexity and acceptance of preeclampsia as a major concern in pregnancy are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the growth of the global preeclampsia diagnostics market. The perception that Asian women are less likely to develop preeclampsia can be harmful to Asian subgroups if such perceptions translate into lower screening rates and fewer outreach campaigns. Such perceptions can also affect the willingness of a healthcare provider to order diagnostic tests during an antenatal examination. Therefore, this factor is further expected to hamper the market’s growth. In order to overcome these issues, the government organizations should take potential measures to introduce the population to the severity of the condition, which will ultimately generate more demand for the preeclampsia diagnostic market in the region.

By test type, the global preeclampsia diagnostics market is segmented into urine analysis, blood test, and others. The blood test segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2035 of USD 2,226.5 Million up from USD 732.8 Million in the year 2022. The level of accuracy in blood test screening makes it the most attractive test among healthcare providers. Moreover, the blood test can provide the results quicker than the other tools used for the diagnosis of preeclampsia. Therefore, it is expected to drive the growth of the segment in the market. However, the severity of the disease cannot be detected using only one type of screening method. Once, the healthcare providers suspect the chances of development of preeclampsia, urine tests are also performed. Significant benefits of urine analysis are over accessibility, convenience, and non-invasive nature.

By region, the Asia Pacific preeclampsia diagnostics market is to witness the fastest revenue growth of CAGR 11.91 % during the forecast period of 2023 to 2035. Several studies have shown that Asian women have a lower risk of preeclampsia than white women, despite facing higher odds of complications. However, researchers aren't sure why Asian and Pacific Islander women have higher odds of preeclampsia complications; thus, this generates a need for effective diagnostic methods to avoid the complications in advance and drive the growth of the preeclampsia diagnostic market in the region. When Asian women are subdivided by geographical origin, there is huge variability in preeclampsia’s relative risk. The notable differences in nativity among Asian women were observed in those from Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, specifically the Philippines, which are at higher risk of preeclampsia. Moreover, obesity is associated with higher rates of preeclampsia, and minority communities experience disproportionate rates of obesity in the region, generating a considerable need to bring in more diagnostic tests.
