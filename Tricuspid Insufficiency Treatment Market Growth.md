The market is segmented by disease type, end user and surgery type. Based on end user, the segment for hospitals is anticipated to grab the largest market share during the forecast period on the back of growing prevalence of open heart and minimally invasive surgeries in hospital facilities. Additionally, on the basis of surgery type, the minimally invasive segment is projected to witness the highest growth over the forecast period ascribing to the faster recovery time and fewer operative complications of these surgeries. 

Geographically, the global tricuspid insufficiency treatment market is segmented into five major regions, namely North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East & Africa. The market in Europe is assessed to grow by a noteworthy rate in the forecast period owing to the rising adoption of this treatment in several European countries, majorly in Germany, and increasing R&D activities associated with cardiovascular medical devices in the region.

***Increasing Preference for Minimally Invasive Heart Surgeries to Boost Market Growth***

Since the last few years, minimally invasive surgeries are widely being preferred over open-heart surgeries by many patients and medical health professionals owing to its benefits such as lower stress on the immune system, less postoperative pain and smaller incision. This is considered to be major factor predicted to drive the demand for tricuspid insufficiency treatment in the near future.

However, absence of awareness about the treatment in lower economic regions is expected to operate as key restraint to the growth of the tricuspid insufficiency treatment market over the forecast period.
