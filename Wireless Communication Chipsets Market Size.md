***Accelerating Urbanization Rate around the World to Boost Market Growth***

A wireless chipset is an internal hardware design used in a wireless communication system or computer to communicate with other wireless devices. Hardware components such as external WLAN (wireless local area network) cards and WLAN adapters use WLAN chipsets. The term urbanization describes the integration of people in a particular geographical area. As a result of this concentration, land is converted to residential, commercial, industrial and transportation purposes. It may include not only densely populated areas, but also adjacent peri-urban or suburban areas. Rural-to-urban population migration, the concomitant decline in the population living in rural areas, and how societies are adapting to this transition are also considered.

Urbanization has increased significantly across the world and is estimated to increase further during the forecast period. Globally, 55% of the population lived in cities in 2018, and this is projected to grow to 68% by 2050. The rate of urbanization is increasing as more and more people show a tendency to move to urban areas. As a result, the demand for high-end technology is increasing and the use of wireless communication chipsets in various activities is increasing. Ultimately, all these factors are expected to drive the expansion of the global wireless communication chipset market during the forecast period. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global wireless communication chipset market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

*•* Increase in research expenses

• Rapid digitization in various organizations around the world

***Challenges**:*

The privacy and data security concerns with data security, and the stringent regulations developed by the government of nations worldwide are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the growth of the global wireless communication chipset market. Privacy refers to the individual's right to keep personal information and activities confidential and not share them without consent. Data security breach refers to the threat of data through unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration or destruction, which is expected to impede market growth over the forecast period.

By IEEE standard, the global wireless communication chipset market is segmented into 802.11be, 802.11ax, and 802.11ac. The 802.11ax segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth of the segment can be attributed to the standard's higher spectral efficiency compared to other existing IEEE standards. Apart from that, 802.11ax has an average speed of around 10 Gbps and a maximum throughput of 30 Gbps. This should also drive future market segment growth. Moreover, the consumer segment based on end-user is estimated to gain the largest share during the forecast period. This is owing to the proliferation of consumer devices, especially smartphones, around the world.

By region, the Asia Pacific wireless communication chipset market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by the fact that the region is increasingly focused on improving technological processes and high manufacturing output. In the year 2020, China's manufacturing output was about USD 3.85 trillion, an increase of 0.8% from the year 2019. Moreover, increasing penetration of the internet among the regional population is expected to boost the market growth in the region in the future. Moreover, the regional market is also expected to gain a prominent share during the forecast period owing to the high adoption rate of modern technology based smart devices and the strong presence of key market players in the region.
