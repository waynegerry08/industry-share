Need for Amplification of Consumer Experiences Amongst Business Organizations by the Optimization of Last Mile Delivery Processes

There is a growing need amongst business organizations worldwide to optimize their last mile delivery operational costs by not lowering the consumer satisfaction indices. Business organizations are opting for various last mile delivery models, such as same-day delivery, next-day delivery, and customized time slot for delivery among others to enhance customer experiences. Moreover, with door step delivery now being more of a mandatory norm, along with the increasing consumer expectations for amplified service delivery, business organizations are increasingly adopting artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based technologies that can help to optimize and enhance their business processes. As AI-enabled last mile delivery technologies help businesses to plan, execute and increase their efficiency, these technologies also contribute to lower their operational costs, which is anticipated to drive the market growth in the coming years.

However, the high initial deployment cost of AI-enabled technologies which raises the level of unwillingness amongst business organizations for the adoption of such technologies is expected to operate as key restraint to the growth of the global AI-enabled last mile delivery market over the forecast period.
