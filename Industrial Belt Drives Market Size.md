By product, the global industrial belt drives market is segmented into industrial V-belt drives, industrial synchronous belt drives, industrial pulleys, and others. The industrial synchronous belt drives segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth can be attributed to the growing automotive sector around the globe. Owing to technological advancements such as the introduction of hybrid and electric vehicles, the automotive industry is constantly changing (EVs). These advancements frequently need specialized synchronous belt drive systems for applications such as electric powertrains, battery cooling systems, and other auxiliary systems. As a result, it is projected that the market for synchronous belt drives made for these applications would grow alongside the acceptance of hybrid and electric vehicles. *Global EV sales have surged by more than 38% as of 2019, while the EV export business has grown by more than 17%.*

By region, the Asia Pacific industrial belt drives market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by a higher number of industrial and mining activities, mainly in China and India. As mining and industrial operations in the area grow, the demand for industrial belt drives could increase. For instance, heavy machinery and equipment, such as conveyor belts, crushers, mills, and separators, are typically required for these processes and rely on industrial belt drives for efficient power transfer. Also, as mining and industrial operations expand, there is a greater demand for industrial belt drives since these operations need dependable, high-performance belt drives to support the operations and keep the machinery running. Additionally, it is projected that the formation of more businesses in the region's emerging economies and increased industry awareness of the need to minimize energy use will support market expansion. Over the projection period, it is also anticipated that the region's rising energy consumption will accelerate market expansion. *India's industrial production rose by more than 6% annually as of 2023, reaching an all-time high of more than 130% in 2021.*
