***Growing Concern for the Prevalence of Cancer & Increased Investments in Healthcare to Promote Global Market Share of Electron Microscope.***

Rising Cancer cases in recent years have contributed positively to the electron microscopes market growth. With the use of an electron microscope, more information about the tumor cell structure is obtained, which is helpful in diagnostic studies. The electron microscope allows for the visualization of cellular intricacies that are not possible with a light microscope due to its superior resolution. This offers insightful morphologic information that might be useful in determining the histogenesis of a tumor—something that light microscopy had previously shown to be impossible. As per our analysis, in 2021, 1.9 million new cancer cases were diagnosed in the United States. 

Further, countries are seen to invest more in their healthcare systems more so, after the pandemic. An efficient public health surveillance system is a key policy lever to increase preparedness, especially in monitoring and limiting the spread of infectious disease, as experience from the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated at a large population level. As per WHO, there has been a rise in global health spending, which accounted for USD 9 trillion in 2020. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global electron microscopes market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Rising Consumer demand for Miniaturization 
- Increasing Demand for Nanotechnology Based Products 

***Challenges:***

High Production costs, the Presence of alternative markets, constant need for maintenance are the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of electron microscopes.

By Application, the global electron microscopes market is segregated into life sciences, material sciences, semiconductors, and nanotechnology. Amongst this   Life sciences segment is anticipated to hold a dominant market position over the forecast period. Other than that, the Nanotechnology segment is also expected to garner significant market share, due to the rising use of nanomaterials in pharmaceutical and healthcare applications, including biomedical devices, implants, and anticancer, antioxidant, and antibacterial characteristics.

By region, North America is expected to gain the largest market share of about 42% over the forecast period. The market is expanding primarily due to the presence of numerous academic institutes, state-of-the-art healthcare facilities, and R&D centers. Additionally, a sizable portion of market participants are situated in the United States. As a result, the money made by these companies helps the North American market expand. Due to the region's less restrictive regulatory environment, easy access to a patient pool, and presence of cutting-edge research infrastructure, major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been interested in conducting clinical trial projects there. Given the benefits of competitive clinical trials, the governments of various nations in the region have streamlined the procedures for obtaining authorization to conduct clinical studies. As a result, there was an increase in the demand for microscopes in the area.

Further, the Electron Microscopes Market in Europe is also anticipated to hold a significant market share. The market growth in Europe is being driven by the increasing development of new microscopes. In the region, Germany is set to dominate the market for electron microscopes. Germany is a hub for manufacturing microscopes. Moreover, with key players dominating the region, the market is growing in the occurrence of such prospects.
