Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) Waste Heat to Power Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/orc-waste-heat-to-power-market/5570): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2035”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global organic rankine cycle (ORC) market in terms of market segmentation by power output, model, application, and by region.

***Growing Adoption of Renewable Energy to Promote Global Market Share of* Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC)**

The global organic rankine cycle (ORC) Waste Heat to Power market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the higher penetration of renewable energy followed by higher investment for boosting the renewable energy capacity. The organic rakine cycle is a process based on thermodynamics used in energy from renewable sources to convert low-temperature heat into useable electricity, such as geothermal heat or solar thermal energy. Renewables will most likely account for approximately 95% of the increase in global power capacity by 2026. The increased investment in renewable energy is promoting energy source variety. While wind and solar power lead the renewable energy scene, others must be explored and utilized. This diversification boosts demand for ORC technology.

Besides this, governments all across the world are working hard to minimize greenhouse gas emissions is also expected to drive the market growth of OCR. Feed-in tariffs, tax breaks, grants, and other policies are examples. ORC systems, which excel at using low-grade heat sources, are well aligned with these goals and receive government assistance.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global organic rankine cycle (ORC) market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Surging Demand for Clean Energy
- Rising Investment in Setting Up Renewable Energy Facility

***Challenges:***

There is a shortage of expert profession to operate the OCR system and there are various other substitutes available in the market are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of organic rankine cycle (ORC). ORC systems involve complex thermodynamic processes and intricate engineering designs. The selection and customization of the working fluid, heat exchangers, turbines, and other components require specialized expertise. The design and integration of ORC systems for specific heat sources and applications can be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge and engineering skills. This complexity can pose barriers to entry and limit the adoption of ORC technology, particularly in regions with a shortage of technical expertise. On the other hand, the cost of equipment, setting up, and modification for focused OCR applications might be exorbitant, hindering market expansion.

On the basis of power output, the global organic rankine cycle (ORC) Waste Heat to Power market is segmented into <1MWe, >1-5MWe, >5-20MWe, and >10Mwe. The <1MWe segment is to generate the maximum revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The rate of carbon generation is substantially lower in generation 1 or less than 1 Mwe power than in high megawatt electrical output. As a result, the category is expected to increase significantly in the long run. Moreover, a rise in the number of capacity generations less than or equal to 1 mwe is also expected to boost the segment’s growth. Furthermore, based on application, the ORC market is further fragmented into waste heat recovery, geothermal, biomass, oil & gas, waste to energy, and solar thermal. Owing to the growing development of geothermal energy plants, the geothermal segment will grow at a notable CAGR over the projected time frame.

By region, the Asia Pacific organic rankine cycle (ORC) Waste Heat to Power market is to grow significantly and will be responsible for a notable share by the end of 2035. The Asia Pacific region has a robust and expanding industrial sector, which generates substantial amounts of waste heat. ORC technology offers an effective solution for harnessing this waste and converting it into electricity.  Industries are increasingly adopting ORC systems for waste heat recovery, enabling them to improve energy efficiency, reduce emissions, and enhance their overall sustainability. The industrial growth in the region contributes to the expanding ORC market. 

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global organic rankine cycle (ORC) Waste Heat to Power market which includes company profiling of Air Squared, Inc., Dürr Group, ENOGIA, Enertime, EXERGY INTERNATIONAL SRL, General Electric Company, ORCAN ENERGY AG, Ormat Technologies, Inc., and Turboden S.p.A.
