**Small Modular Reactor Market size and Share** 

Research Nester has published a detailed market report on ‘[**Small Modular Reactor Market**](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/small-modular-reactor-market/4846)’ for the forecast period, i.e. 2023 – 2035 which includes factors, such as, market growth over the forecast period, detailed regional synopsis, market segmentation, growth drivers, and key market players and their detailed profiling.

The global small modular reactor market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of ~5.7% over the forecast period. The market is estimated to garner a revenue of nearly USD 12.95 billion by the end of 2035, up from a revenue of about USD 6.66 billion in the year 2022. The growth of the market is attributed to the increasing development of small modular reactors. More than 70 commercial SMR designs are being developed worldwide for a variety of outputs and applications including power, integrated power systems, heating, water desalination and industrial steam. Akademik Lomonosov, Russia's first floating nuclear power plant, went into commercial operation in May 2020 and is powered by two 35 MW(e) SMRs. In addition, several other SMR projects are in the licensing process.

These are located in Russia, South Korea, Canada, Argentina and the United States of America. Among the other factors that are believed to drive the growth of the small modular reactors market is the increasing depletion of fresh water in the world. This will likely result in the need for a desalination process to produce potable water. According to a UNESCO estimate from 2002, the global freshwater gap was 230 billion m3/year at the time and is expected to increase to 2000 billion m3/year by 2025. Nuclear desalination is typically less expensive than using fossil fuels. In addition, in the short term, only nuclear reactors will be able to supply the massive amounts of electricity needed to run large-scale desalination projects.

***Increasing Initiatives Associated with Decarbonization across the Globe to Boost Market Growth***

SMRs have reduced the amount of fuel needed. SMR-based power plants may require less frequent refueling, which in turn can significantly reduce CO2 emissions. According to the World Economic Forum, nine new industrial clusters from the US, Europe and Asia have been added as part of the Industry Clusters in Transition to Net Zero initiative. The aim is to connect 100 industrial clusters around the world to reduce 1.6 billion tons of CO2 emissions. The modest size and high degree of modularity of the SMR allow for a simple combination of a nuclear power plant and a desalination plant. In order to increase the capacity of the volume of fresh water produced by desalination, an investment of 10 billion US dollars is expected over the next five years. This investment is expected to increase capacity to 5.7 million cubic meters per day. In addition, capacity is expected to double by 2030.Small modular reactors can meet variable power generation needs for a wider range of users and applications. Increasing business activity and the growing global economy are expected to increase energy demand by around 15%.

**Global Small Modular Reactor Market: Regional Overview**

The global small modular reactor market is segmented into five major regions including North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa region.

***Expanding government initiative to Drive the Market Growth in North America Region***

The small modular reactor market in North America region is estimated to garner the largest revenue by the end of 2035. The growth of the market is mainly attributed to the increasing government initiative to implement small modular reactors. The Advanced SMR R&D program, launched in fiscal 2019, supports research, development and implementation initiatives aimed at accelerating the commercialization of US-developed SMR technology in local and international markets. Additionally, in 2018, the Department of Nuclear Power announced a multi-year cost-sharing funding opportunity (US Industry Opportunities for Advanced Nuclear Technology Development, DE-FOA-0001817).This opportunity offers the potential to develop existing, new and next-generation reactor designs, including SMR technology. Additionally, in April 2023, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the design of the United States' first small modular nuclear reactor.

***Growing nuclear energy replacement and diversification to Propel the Growth in the Europe Region***

The small modular reactor market in the Europe region is estimated to garner the highest CAGR by the end of 2035. The growth of the market in this region can primarily be attributed to nuclear energy replacement and diversification. Several European countries rely on aging nuclear power plants that are nearing their end of life. SMRs offer a potential solution for replacing these plants and ensuring a continued supply of low-carbon electricity. Additionally, SMRs provide an opportunity for countries without existing nuclear infrastructure to enter the nuclear power market. According to a report, Europe is expected to retire around 50 GW of nuclear capacity by 2030, creating a need for replacement options. SMRs can enhance energy security by providing a reliable and independent source of electricity. They can be deployed in remote locations, off-grid areas, or to support critical infrastructure. In Europe, the integration of SMRs into the grid can strengthen grid resilience and provide a stable power supply during peak demand periods or in emergency situations. These factors are crucial in ensuring a secure and resilient energy system. The development of advanced reactor technologies and manufacturing capabilities has contributed to the growth of the SMR market in Europe. Improved designs, standardized components, and factory production techniques are expected to drive down costs and accelerate deployment.
