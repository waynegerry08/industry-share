**Metal Casting Market Size and Growth**

The global [**Metal Casting Market**](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/metal-casting-market/5133) is anticipated to rise at a CAGR of ~6% over the forecast period, i.e., 2023-2035. Furthermore, the market is set to capture revenue of ~USD 280 billion by the end of 2035, up from a revenue of ~USD 135 billion in the year 2022. The major factor driving the sector's growth is a rise in the production of automobiles. *In 2022, there has been a rise in the production of automobiles by about 4% in the world, which equates to approximately 84 automotive produced.*  Metal casting is a method employed in the automotive industry for producing a variety of equipment out of ferrous, non-ferrous, and their alloys. Different casting techniques are used in this business to produce these parts since they are an efficient approach to building parts that are inexpensive, lightweight, and simple to install. 

Moreover, die casting is the most used method in casting automotive. In die casting metals such as zinc, and aluminum the extensively used metals owing to their advantages. For instance, in the case of aluminum, it is said to be environmentally friendly since it causes the least amount of emission and low waste into the environment. Also, the use of recycled aluminum is growing which is also estimated to cause low carbon emissions in the air. *For instance, new aluminum manufactured by recycling scraps of aluminum is set to emit close to 10% as compared to aluminum made from bauxite ore. This is since, it is estimated to use less than 95% of energy.* Therefore, this factor is set to boosting the market for metal casting.
