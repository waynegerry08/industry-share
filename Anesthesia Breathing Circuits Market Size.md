***Growing Concern for the Prevalence of Chronic Diseases to Promote Global Market Share of Anesthesia Breathing Circuits Market***

The global anesthesia breathing circuits market is estimated to grow majorly on account of rising chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders, and pulmonary embolism, along with other sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea among the global population. Furthermore, the growing geriatric population is more prone to susceptible to respiratory disorders, and the adoption of a sedentary lifestyle with the consumption of alcohol and cigarettes is increasing the chances of breathing problems and hence favoring the market growth during the forecast period. Along with the other factors, the rising deaths owing to increased levels of air pollution are also estimated to bring lucrative growth opportunities for market expansion in the upcoming years. In addition, the increasing number of surgeries and the high investments in the healthcare sector by government bodies and private organizations is estimated to help in a robust revenue generation in the next years.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global anesthesia breathing circuits market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Surge in Research and Development Activities for Advanced Anesthesia Breathing Bags
- Growing Consumer Spending on Health 

***Challenges:***

Rising concerns regarding the unavailability of trained medical professionals, the high costs of the products, and stringent government rules related to the efficacy of anesthesia breathing circuits are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of the anesthesia breathing circuits market.

By application, the global anesthesia breathing circuits market is segmented into anesthesia and respiratory dysfunction. The respiratory dysfunction segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The primary factor that is attributed to the growing segment size is the rising cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARSD) which needs efficient mechanical ventilation, intubation, and specialized breathing circuits. Also, medical conditions like respiratory illnesses across the globe are estimated to favor segment growth in the upcoming years.

By region, the European anesthesia breathing circuits market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by growing cases of lifestyle diseases such as obesity and diabetes, especially in the U.K. and Germany which led to the demand for breathing systems during the treatment process. Furthermore, rising per capita income and ongoing economic development are other factors that are estimated to create a positive outlook for segment expansion.
